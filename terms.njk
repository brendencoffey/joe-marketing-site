      <ul>
        <li>To be bound by these Terms and Conditions of Use;</li>
        <li>You are, and shall remain, responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations; and</li>
        <li>That if you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms and Conditions of Use on behalf of your employer or other entity, you represent and warrant to Joe Coffee that you have legal authority to bind that entity to these Terms and Conditions of Use.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>If you do not agree with any of the terms and conditions herein, you must forego using or accessing the Site. The Privacy Policy is incorporated herein by reference and forms an integral part of this agreement. As described more fully below, the materials contained in this Site are protected by applicable copyright and trademark law.</p>

      <h2>Our Services</h2>
      <p>The Site connects you with local vendors and merchants to provide you with products, goods, and services that local vendors and merchants provide. You may order food, drink, and beverages from these local vendors and merchants through the Site. Joe Coffee is not a restaurant or food, beverage, or drink preparation entity.</p>
      
      <p>Joe Coffee or its local vendors and merchants may, from time to time, promote and provide you the opportunity to redeem unique promotional codes for discounts on products, goods, and services provided by local vendors and merchants ("Promotional Codes"). You understand and agree that your redemption of Promotional Codes shall be subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations set forth in conjunction with the Promotional Code. You understand and agree that Joe Coffee and its local vendors and merchants are under no obligation to provide any Promotional Codes and that any Promotional Codes provided may be only available for a limited time. The Promotional Codes are subject to modification or cancellation at any time. The Promotional Codes may be limited to a one-time use and may be limited to qualifying products, goods, or services. The Promotional Codes are non-transferable and may not be resold. If any product, good, or service is returned, your refund will equal the amount you paid for the product, good, or service, subject to applicable refund policies. The Promotional Code must be redeemed at the time you place your order; Promotional Codes may not be redeemed retroactively for prior purchases or orders. You must agree to, and abide by, these Terms and Conditions of Use in order to be eligible to use the Promotional Codes. Promotional Codes may not be redeemed for cash or cash equivalents.</p>

      <h2>Transactions Involving Alcohol</h2>
      <p>You may have the option to order alcoholic beverages and drinks through the Site; however, the local vendors and merchants have sole and final discretion regarding sales of alcohol products or goods to you. If you wish to order any alcohol products or goods on the Site, you agree that you will only order alcohol products or goods if you are 21 years of age or older. You also agree that upon picking up your order, you shall provide valid government-issued identification proving your age to the local vendor or merchant whom you have ordered goods, products, or services from and you will not be intoxicated when receiving alcohol products or goods.</p>

      <h2>Consumer Rewards</h2>
      <p>By participating in our Consumer Rewards program, you agree to the following terms:</p>
      <p>Customers who load a balance onto their store-specific loyalty card will be enrolled in our "Spend $100, Get 1 Free Drink" program. Under this program, once you have spent a total of $100 at participating locations, you will be eligible to receive one free drink. The program is structured so that each qualifying purchase contributes towards your reward balance, with a typical purchase amounting to $10 per transaction. Customers who do not load a balance onto their loyalty card will still earn rewards, albeit at half the rate of those who have added a balance.</p>
      
      <p>To further enhance customer engagement, Joe Coffee offers additional features within the Consumer Rewards program:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Weekly Bonuses:</strong> We may offer rotating bonuses designed to encourage frequent purchases, including but not limited to Double Points Days, a Monday bonus of 100 additional points, and a Friday bonus for customers who make multiple purchases in a single day.</li>
        <li><strong>Refer-a-Friend Promotion:</strong> Customers who participate in our refer-a-friend program can earn additional rewards by referring new customers to participating shops. The referring customer will earn points once the referred customer completes their first purchase.</li>
        <li><strong>First-Time Purchase Incentives:</strong> Joe Coffee may allocate a budget to incentivize new customers to make their first purchase at participating locations.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>By opting into the Consumer Rewards program, you consent to providing your phone number for the purpose of receiving SMS reminders related to rewards and promotions. You may opt out of these SMS reminders at any time by following the instructions provided in the message or by contacting us directly.</p>

      <h2>Gift Cards and Shop Loyalty Cards</h2>
      <p>Consumers may purchase or redeem a Joe Coffee gift card ("Gift Card") to be used toward the purchase of Merchant goods and services. Consumers may also purchase a Merchant-specific Gift Card, or Merchant may grant Consumers a Merchant-specific Gift Card as part of a loyalty promotion, to be redeemed toward the purchase of goods and services only from Merchant's location ("Shop Loyalty Card"). Merchant must redeem all Gift Cards, including Shop Loyalty Cards, in compliance with Joe Coffee's consumer terms and conditions and applicable law. The value of Gift Cards, including Shop Loyalty Cards, will be passed to the Merchant for all payment types, minus the standard fee associated with digital purchases. In the event the Merchant leaves Joe Coffee, or a Customer requests a refund, the Merchant is responsible for any refunds in accordance with their state laws.</p>

      <h2>Account Funds</h2>
      <p>You may deposit money, of any currency, in any value greater than ten dollars ($10 USD) into your account to be used at any Joe Coffee location ("Account Funds"). We shall hold all Account Funds in an escrow account until you choose to use the Account Funds, upon which the requested Account Funds will be released for you to use toward your purchase. Your Account Funds may be eligible for certain discounts, offers and/or rewards depending on the total balance in your account and funds spent. Account Funds on their own are not eligible for Rewards unless spent.</p>
      <p>Reimbursements are available upon written request. Users will be required to email help@joe.coffee with their name, email, phone number and amount requested.
