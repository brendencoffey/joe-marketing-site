    <div class="prose max-w-none">
      <p>By accessing or using this website, merchant application, consumer application, or mobile application (collectively, the "Site") associated with Coffey Ventures, Inc. DBA Joe Coffee ("Joe Coffee") or making any purchases on or through the Site, you agree:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>To be bound by these Terms and Conditions of Use;</li>
        <li>You are, and shall remain, responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations; and</li>
        <li>That if you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms and Conditions of Use on behalf of your employer or other entity, you represent and warrant to Joe Coffee that you have legal authority to bind that entity to these Terms and Conditions of Use.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>If you do not agree with any of the terms and conditions herein, you must forego using or accessing the Site. The Privacy Policy is incorporated herein by reference and forms an integral part of this agreement. As described more fully below, the materials contained in this Site are protected by applicable copyright and trademark law.</p>

      <h2>Our Services</h2>
      <p>The Site connects you with local vendors and merchants to provide you with products, goods, and services that local vendors and merchants provide. You may order food, drink, and beverages from these local vendors and merchants through the Site. Joe Coffee is not a restaurant or food, beverage, or drink preparation entity.</p>
      
      <p>Joe Coffee or its local vendors and merchants may, from time to time, promote and provide you the opportunity to redeem unique promotional codes for discounts on products, goods, and services provided by local vendors and merchants ("Promotional Codes"). You understand and agree that your redemption of Promotional Codes shall be subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations set forth in conjunction with the Promotional Code. You understand and agree that Joe Coffee and its local vendors and merchants are under no obligation to provide any Promotional Codes and that any Promotional Codes provided may be only available for a limited time. The Promotional Codes are subject to modification or cancellation at any time. The Promotional Codes may be limited to a one-time use and may be limited to qualifying products, goods, or services. The Promotional Codes are non-transferable and may not be resold. If any product, good, or service is returned, your refund will equal the amount you paid for the product, good, or service, subject to applicable refund policies. The Promotional Code must be redeemed at the time you place your order; Promotional Codes may not be redeemed retroactively for prior purchases or orders. You must agree to, and abide by, these Terms and Conditions of Use in order to be eligible to use the Promotional Codes. Promotional Codes may not be redeemed for cash or cash equivalents.</p>

      <h2>Transactions Involving Alcohol</h2>
      <p>You may have the option to order alcoholic beverages and drinks through the Site; however, the local vendors and merchants have sole and final discretion regarding sales of alcohol products or goods to you. If you wish to order any alcohol products or goods on the Site, you agree that you will only order alcohol products or goods if you are 21 years of age or older. You also agree that upon picking up your order, you shall provide valid government-issued identification proving your age to the local vendor or merchant whom you have ordered goods, products, or services from and you will not be intoxicated when receiving alcohol products or goods. If you order alcohol products or goods, you understand and acknowledge that Joe Coffee cannot accept your order of alcohol products or goods if the local vendor or merchant whom you have ordered alcohol products or goods from refuses to accept your order. If you have ordered alcohol products or goods and the local vendor or merchant whom you have ordered alcohol products or goods from refuses to accept your order or refuses to provide the alcohol products or goods to you, you will not be charged for the amount of the alcohol products or goods. If you have been charged for the alcohol products or goods you ordered and the local vendor or merchant refuses to accept your order or refuses to provide you the alcohol products or goods, you will be refunded the amount for the alcohol products or goods. Some reasons why a local vendor or merchant may refuse your order or refuse to provide the alcohol products or goods you've ordered include that you are not over 21 years of age, you cannot provide a valid government-issued identification, the name on your valid government-issued identification does not match the name for your order, or you are visibly intoxicated. If you order alcohol products or goods, you agree that you will comply with all applicable laws in the state you are ordering in, and the state you are picking up your order in, and that you will not cause Joe Coffee or any vendor or merchant to contravene any applicable laws.</p>

        <li>Use the Site to purchase alcohol products or goods unless you are 21 years of age or older and present a valid government-issued identification verifying you are at least 21 years of age at the time you pick up your order of alcohol products or goods;</li>
        <li>Remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the Materials; or</li>
        <li>Transfer the Materials to another person or "mirror" the Materials on any other server.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Ownership</h2>
      <p>The Materials and the Site consist of copyrighted works owned by Joe Coffee. Subject to the license granted to you and other users, Joe Coffee reserves all other rights, including without limitation, all intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights, in connection with the Materials. Joe Coffee has created, owns, has licensed, or otherwise has rights to use all of the content that appears in the Materials. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, you agree that you have no right or title in or to any content that appears in the Materials.</p>

      <h2>Consumer Rewards</h2>
      <p>By participating in our Consumer Rewards program, you agree to the following terms:</p>
      <p>Customers who load a balance onto their store-specific loyalty card will be enrolled in our "Spend $100, Get 1 Free Drink" program. Under this program, once you have spent a total of $100 at participating locations, you will be eligible to receive one free drink. The program is structured so that each qualifying purchase contributes towards your reward balance, with a typical purchase amounting to $10 per transaction. Customers who do not load a balance onto their loyalty card will still earn rewards, albeit at half the rate of those who have added a balance.</p>
      
      <p>To further enhance customer engagement, Joe Coffee offers additional features within the Consumer Rewards program:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Weekly Bonuses:</strong> We may offer rotating bonuses designed to encourage frequent purchases, including but not limited to Double Points Days, a Monday bonus of 100 additional points, and a Friday bonus for customers who make multiple purchases in a single day.</li>
        <li><strong>Refer-a-Friend Promotion:</strong> Customers who participate in our refer-a-friend program can earn additional rewards by referring new customers to participating shops. The referring customer will earn points once the referred customer completes their first purchase.</li>
        <li><strong>First-Time Purchase Incentives:</strong> Joe Coffee may allocate a budget to incentivize new customers to make their first purchase at participating locations.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>By opting into the Consumer Rewards program, you consent to providing your phone number for the purpose of receiving SMS reminders related to rewards and promotions. You may opt out of these SMS reminders at any time by following the instructions provided in the message or by contacting us directly.</p>
      
      <p>Joe Coffee will manage these rewards and bonuses through our proprietary technology and data systems, ensuring that customers receive the maximum benefit while minimizing costs for merchants. By utilizing our network, we are able to provide these benefits at a cost that is less than half of what traditional marketing efforts might incur.</p>
      
      <p>Customers can access and redeem rewards, manage loyalty balances, and apply discounts across various platforms, including Point-of-Sale systems, the Joe Coffee App, our website, and, when available, Kiosk systems.</p>
      
      <p>By participating in the Consumer Rewards program, you acknowledge that the terms and availability of specific rewards and bonuses may change at any time, and your continued use of the program constitutes acceptance of such changes.</p>

      <h2>Gift Cards and Shop Loyalty Cards</h2>
      <p>Consumers may purchase or redeem a Joe Coffee gift card ("Gift Card") to be used toward the purchase of Merchant goods and services. Consumers may also purchase a Merchant-specific Gift Card, or Merchant may grant Consumers a Merchant-specific Gift Card as part of a loyalty promotion, to be redeemed toward the purchase of goods and services only from Merchant's location ("Shop Loyalty Card"). Merchant must redeem all Gift Cards, including Shop Loyalty Cards, in compliance with Joe Coffee's consumer terms and conditions and applicable law. The value of Gift Cards, including Shop Loyalty Cards, will be passed to the Merchant for all payment types, minus the standard fee associated with digital purchases. In the event the Merchant leaves Joe Coffee, or a Customer requests a refund, the Merchant is responsible for any refunds in accordance with their state laws.</p>

      <h2>Account Funds</h2>
      <p>You may deposit money, of any currency, in any value greater than ten dollars ($10 USD) into your account to be used at any Joe Coffee location ("Account Funds"). We shall hold all Account Funds in an escrow account until you choose to use the Account Funds, upon which the requested Account Funds will be released for you to use toward your purchase. Your Account Funds may be eligible for certain discounts, offers and/or rewards depending on the total balance in your account and funds spent. Account Funds on their own are not eligible for Rewards unless spent.</p>
      
      <p>Reimbursements are available upon written request. Users will be required to email help@joe.coffee with their name, email, phone number and amount requested. Upon account verification, Joe Coffee will reimburse remaining funds via Stripe. Reimbursements will take 3-10 business days to show in your bank account.</p>
      
      <p>We collect data necessary to process your payment, such as your payment instrument number (such as a credit card number), and the security code associated with your payment instrument. All payment data is stored by a secure third-party payment gateway. We do not store your payment information, and we only share that information with our secure third-party payment gateway in order to process the payments or refunds required for your account. Joe Coffee cannot guarantee the accuracy of payment information, which is the responsibility of the parties, and cannot be responsible for delay or interruption of payments due to inaccurate information. When you provide payment information to the Site, you consent to transactions initiated by you and enabled by the Site. Payment features are enabled through our secured third-party payment gateway, Stripe, which may request additional payment information from time to time to enable certain features of the Site, which features may become unavailable if you do not provide such additional information.</p>
      
      <p>Because orders, payments, refunds, and rewards incorporate Stripe services, by using the Site, you also agree to be bound by Stripe's Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policies, available at: <a href="https://stripe.com/legal" target="_blank">Stripe Legal</a>.</p>

      <p>Once a Gift Card is purchased, the Gift Card recipient will receive a text message containing a link to redeem the Gift Card by registering or logging into the recipient's Joe Coffee account. Once redeemed, Gift Card funds can be used in the same manner as Account Funds. However, Joe Coffee reserves the right to prohibit the use of Gift Card funds for certain products and services.</p>
