    <div class="prose max-w-none">
      <p>This Merchant Terms and Conditions of Use (the "Agreement" or "Terms") is a legal agreement between you ("Merchant" or "You" or "Your") and Coffey Ventures, Inc., a Delaware corporation, DBA Joe Coffee (the "Company"). This Agreement contains the terms and conditions that govern Your access to and use of all product lines including (the "Apps"), but not limited to, the website, merchant application, mobile application, point-of-sale, and kiosk of the Company. By downloading, subscribing to, or in any way accessing the Apps, You agree to follow and abide by these Terms, and You agree that You are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. If You do not agree with any of the Terms herein, You must forego using or accessing the Apps.</p>

      <p>In addition, if You choose to use the Square App Market for integration purposes, You understand and acknowledge that You may be bound by the applicable Square terms and conditions of use.</p>

      <h2>1. Important Information</h2>
      <p>These Terms govern Your use of the Apps. The Apps must be installed on a compatible mobile device in order to access and use the Company's Apps. The Company does not warrant that the Company's Apps will be compatible with Your mobile or other computing device or carrier. Your use of the Apps may be subject to the terms of Your agreements with Your mobile device manufacturer or Your carrier.</p>

      <p>By accessing the Apps, You agree to comply with this Agreement, and that Your use of the Apps, and any dispute arising out of Your use, will be governed by this Agreement. If You are using the Apps on behalf of a company or other entity, or if You contract for services on behalf of a company or other entity, You represent and warrant that You have full legal authority to access the Apps on behalf of that entity and bind it to these Terms. If You are not authorized, You may not accept these Terms for someone else.</p>

      <h2>2. Reliability of Information</h2>
      <p>The Company does its best to provide the most accurate information possible with regard to our Apps, but it is impossible to guarantee accuracy. The Company does not offer to provide information that is error-free, up-to-date, or appropriate for Your needs.</p>

      <p>The Apps are available only for individuals who are thirteen (13) years or older, and the Company does not knowingly collect information from persons under the age of thirteen (13). If You are thirteen (13) or older but under eighteen (18) (or the legal age of majority where You reside if that jurisdiction has an age of majority older than eighteen (18)), You must review the Terms with Your parent or guardian to make sure that both You and Your parent or guardian understand and agree to this Agreement, and Your parent or guardian must accept this Agreement on Your behalf.</p>

      <h2>3. Payments and How It Works</h2>
      <p>Features of the Apps enable payments, including those from Merchants and consumers, which rely on accurate bank account, credit card, and information provided by parties to the transaction. We collect data necessary to process your payment, such as your payment instrument number (such as a credit card number) and the security code associated with your payment instrument. All payment data is stored by a secure third-party payment gateway. We do not store your payment information, and we only share that information with our secure third-party payment gateway in order to process the payments or refunds required for your account. The Company cannot guarantee the accuracy of payment information, which is the responsibility of the parties, and cannot be responsible for delay or interruption of payments due to inaccurate information.</p>

      <p>Because orders, payments, refunds, and rewards incorporate Stripe services, by using the Apps, You also agree to be bound by Stripe's Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policies, available at: <a href="https://stripe.com/us/connect-account/legal" target="_blank">https://stripe.com/us/connect-account/legal</a>.</p>

      <h2>4. Payments by Merchant</h2>
      <p>The Company provides payment processing services to Merchants through Stripe, Inc. ("Stripe"). The standard rates for payment processing are 2.6% + $0.10 per transaction for in-person payments and 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction for online and app-based payments.</p>

      <p>In addition to these payment processing fees, Merchants shall pay usage-based fees ranging from three percent (3%) to five percent (5%) for additional services provided by the Company, which may include but are not limited to, loyalty card uploads and online payment services.</p>

      <p>The Company also centrally manages a proprietary rewards program on behalf of Merchants. The Company funds reward redemptions across the network through a reward redemption budget, which is comprised of up to ten percent (10%) of every loyalty payment made by consumers. The Company shall be responsible for covering the costs of reward redemptions across the network using the allocated reward redemption budget.</p>

      <p>Merchants acknowledge and agree that the fees described herein are subject to change, and the Company reserves the right to modify these fees at any time upon providing notice to the Merchant as outlined in this Agreement.</p>

      <h2>5. Payout Cadence</h2>
      <p>You may have payment remitted daily or weekly depending on the product line and the terms You negotiate with the Company. Additional fees may apply for daily deposits for shops that don't utilize the complete Ordering System, including Point-of-Sale.</p>

      <h2>6. Consumer Rewards Program for Coffee Shops</h2>
      <p>By participating in the Joe Coffee Consumer Rewards Program (the "Program"), you, as a participating coffee shop ("Merchant"), agree to the following terms and conditions:</p>

      <h3>Program Enrollment and Benefits</h3>
      <p>Joe Coffee will manage the rewards program centrally, allowing every shop on the platform to offer customer rewards without the typical risks associated with such programs. Customers who load a balance onto their store-specific loyalty card will be enrolled in the "Spend $100, Get 1 Free Drink" program, under which they will receive one free drink after spending a total of $100 at participating locations. Purchases made by customers without a loaded balance will also qualify for rewards but will accrue points at half the rate.</p>

      <h3>Merchant Costs and Fees</h3>
      <p>To cover the costs associated with managing the rewards, paying for redemptions network-wide, and providing program support, Joe Coffee charges participating Merchants a percentage of loyalty payments, which is agreed upon in advance and capped at a maximum of 10%. This fee ensures that your shop can offer an attractive and effective loyalty program while minimizing the financial burden and risks typically associated with such programs.</p>

      <h3>Enhanced Customer Engagement Features</h3>
      <p>Joe Coffee provides additional promotional features to help drive customer engagement and increase sales:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Weekly Bonuses:</strong> Joe Coffee may offer rotating bonuses, such as Double Points Days, a Monday bonus of 100 points, or a Friday bonus for customers who make multiple purchases in a day. These promotions are designed to encourage repeat visits and increase customer loyalty.</li>
        <li><strong>Refer-a-Friend Program:</strong> The Program includes a refer-a-friend component, enabling customers to earn additional rewards by referring new customers to your shop and other participating locations. This encourages organic growth and new customer acquisition.</li>
        <li><strong>First-Time Purchase Incentives:</strong> Joe Coffee may allocate a budget to incentivize new customers to make their first purchase at your shop or other participating locations, driving initial customer engagement.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Reward Management and Technology</h3>
      <p>Joe Coffee manages all rewards, bonuses, and customer engagement activities through its proprietary technology and data systems. This centralized approach ensures a consistent customer experience and reduces administrative overhead for Merchants. Joe Coffee will handle all logistics related to reward accrual, redemption, and program updates.</p>

      <h3>Redemption and Accessibility</h3>
      <p>Customers can redeem rewards, manage loyalty balances, and apply discounts through various Joe Coffee-enabled platforms, including Point-of-Sale systems, the Joe Coffee App, the Joe Coffee website, and Kiosk systems, where available.</p>

      <h3>Program Modifications and Notifications</h3>
      <p>Joe Coffee reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the Program or any specific rewards, bonuses, or terms at any time. Merchants will be notified of any material changes to the Program. Continued participation in the Program following such changes constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

      <h2>7. Gift Cards and Shop Loyalty Cards</h2>
      <p>Consumers may purchase or redeem a Joe Coffee gift card ("Gift Card") to be used toward the purchase of Merchant goods and services. Consumers may also purchase a Merchant-specific Gift Card, or Merchant may grant Consumers a Merchant-specific Gift Card as part of a loyalty promotion, to be redeemed toward the purchase of goods and services only from Merchant's location ("Shop Loyalty Card"). Merchant must redeem all Gift Cards, including Shop Loyalty Cards, in compliance with Joe Coffee's consumer terms and conditions and applicable law. The value of Gift Cards, including Shop Loyalty Cards, will be passed to the Merchant for all payment types, minus the standard fee associated with digital purchases. In the event the Merchant leaves Joe Coffee, or a Customer requests a refund, the Merchant is responsible for any refunds in accordance with their state laws.</p>

      <h2>8. Invoices and Accounting</h2>
      <p>For any rewards-related disputes, You shall submit a monthly invoice to the Company for all Rewards, Gift Card redemptions, and Global Code redemptions redeemed by consumers. All invoices shall be submitted electronically to the Company. The Company shall pay or dispute Your invoice within thirty days from receipt of the invoice.</p>

      <p>The Company will submit a weekly accounting to You with respect to Charges, Gift Card redemptions, Global Code redemptions, and Rewards. You will need to add the e-mail address you wish to have the weekly reports emailed to in your merchant dashboard under "Notifications."</p>

      <h2>9. Merchant Promotions</h2>
      <p>If You receive "owner" status for Your merchant account, You may have the capability of creating unique promotional codes for Your merchant account with the Company ("Merchant Codes"). "Owner" status may be granted to You if You have provided the Company the information requested by the Company, as needed, to verify Your merchant account. Merchant Codes can be in the form of providing a discounted percentage or discounted dollar amount (e.g., 10% off or $1 off) for Your products, goods, or services. You may set certain limitations on the use of Your Merchant Codes. Merchant Codes You promote and honor are Your responsibility and obligation.</p>

      <h2>10. Company Promotions</h2>
      <p>From time to time, the Company may promote certain unique promotional codes on behalf of the Company, which may be used with all merchants ("Global Codes"). The Company will compensate You for the amounts attributable to Global Codes used at Your store. The Global Codes may be for a limited time, and the Company reserves the right to modify or cancel the offer related to the Global Codes.</p>

      <h2>11. Taxes Generally</h2>
      <p>It is Merchant's responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments Merchant makes or receives, and it is Merchant's responsibility to collect, report, and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. The Company is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to Merchant's transaction with either consumers or the Company, or for collecting, reporting, or remitting any taxes arising from any transaction with or by Merchant and consumers or the Company.</p>

      <h2>12. Modifications to the Agreement</h2>
      <p>The Company may modify this Agreement at any time by giving notice to You, which notice shall be made by posting a revised version of this Agreement on the Apps or by notifying You in accordance with this Agreement. The modified Terms will become effective as stated in the message announcing the change in Terms. Your continued use of the Apps after the effective date of any modification to this Agreement will be deemed Your acceptance of such modifications.</p>

      <h2>13. Consumer Data Restrictions</h2>
      <p><strong>Consumer Data.</strong> "Consumer Data" means all identifiable information about consumers generated or collected by You or the Company, including, but not limited to, consumers' names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, preferences and tendencies, and financial transaction data. We do not sell Consumer Data.</p>

      <p>Merchant shall use Consumer Data only to fulfill its redemption obligations. Merchant expressly agrees that any Consumer Data shall be used only for this purpose, and not to enhance a file or list owned by Merchant, or any third-party. Merchant represents, warrants, and covenants that it will not sell, resell, share, distribute, broker, or otherwise disclose any Consumer Data to any third-party, in whole or in part, for any purpose, unless required by applicable law or required to perform the services herein.</p>

      <h2>14. The Apps</h2>
      <p>The Apps consist of copyrighted and other proprietary information and materials owned by the Company. Subject to Section 7.2, the Company reserves all right, title, and interest in and to the Apps and all of our proprietary information and materials provided to You through the Apps, including any related intellectual property rights, and You obtain no right, title, or interest under this Agreement in or to the Apps or the Company's information or materials.</p>
