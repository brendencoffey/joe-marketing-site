With lower overhead and fewer barriers of entry, renovated trailers have become a popular option for first-time coffee shop owners to get into the indie coffee game.

Kristina Perez Thomas is the owner of Soul Good Coffee, a new coffee trailer that has been slinging delicious drinks and traveling in the suburbs of Chicago, IL since early summer 2022.

## The Challenge

For Soul Good Coffee, the challenges of being a new, mobile business include:
- Finding at least one sustainable location
- Creating loyal customers while moving from day-to-day

## The Solution

With joe Point of Sale and built-in loyalty, Kristina is able to effortlessly connect with the community and utilize the built-in loyalty features and automated marketing to establish her coffee business.

> "joe is like having another *full-time* employee who is dedicated to promoting my coffee shop! Even while mobile, all of the built in features have made it easy for customers to find me, and the loyalty is really what keeps our locals coming back."

## The Results

> "We've seen so much growth and change month over month!"

And in just 6 months of operating, Kristina is now taking the next step to a brick-and-mortar. Renting a space for the winter, Kristina is looking to further grow her business and serve her loyal customers the delicious coffee they've come to love.
