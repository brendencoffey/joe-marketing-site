## Overview: A Community Hub in Junction City, Kansas

Located in the heart of Junction City, Kansas, Paradox Coffee & Bistro has become a cornerstone for the diverse local population, which includes military families, stay-at-home parents, and elderly residents.

Founded 3.5 years ago by Tiffany Naccarato and her husband—both medical professionals—along with two other business partners, Paradox Coffee has evolved into a thriving community space.

## The Challenge: Balancing Community Values with Modern Technology

The founders of Paradox Coffee envisioned creating a place that reflected and supported the local community. They prioritized partnerships with local vendors and artisans, sourcing farm-to-table ingredients, locally roasted coffee, and hand-crafted decor.

However, the leadership team recognized that maintaining strong customer engagement required more than just in-person interaction.

> "We knew that if there's not a way for the community to connect with us digitally, even though we're not always tech-savvy in the Midwest, people like to use their technology."

## The Solution: Seamless Integration with joe OS

After an extensive search, Paradox Coffee implemented joe OS, a platform designed specifically for coffee shops.

> "It was very, very simple to learn, to train my baristas, and is so easy to use on the backend. It's been so seamless."

Another critical feature was joe's pricing structure:

> "With no monthly subscriptions, I feel like joe is just as invested in the success of my business as I am. We're not just another account. Joe really cares about us as a company and as a brand and wants us to be as successful as we can."

## The Results

### Enhanced Customer Satisfaction
Customers rated their experience at Paradox Coffee 4.8 out of 5.

### Boost in Revenue Through Loyalty
In the past 30 days, $9,000 of Paradox Coffee's nearly $30,000 in monthly revenue was attributed to joe's loyalty marketing program.

### Growth and Expansion Plans
With streamlined operations and increased revenue, Paradox Coffee is now positioned to open two additional locations in the coming year.
