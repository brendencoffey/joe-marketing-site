## Meet Zero Tolerance Coffee + Chocolate

Zero Tolerance Coffee + Chocolate owners Maura and Roy are true artisans and visionaries for their community. Located off of Route 66 in OKC, Zero Tolerance Coffee offers delectable "bean to bar" chocolate and handcrafted coffee beverages.

When first opening their doors, the district of the city wasn't thriving. But taking a chance, and working hard to survive the pandemic, other small businesses saw Zero Tolerance as a success and followed suit.

Now their district is home to new restaurants, microbreweries, an upscale barbershop and a distillery.

## The Challenge

For several years, Zero Tolerance was operating with Square. But in 2022, hidden fees and processing costs were adding up.

> "I felt like Square was nickel-ing and dime-ing, so I started researching other point of sale options. After talking with a joe rep, I was really excited about upgrading to joe Point of Sale!"

## joe Point of Sale with Built-in Loyalty

While using Square, Maura and Roy never opted to use Square loyalty or marketing because of the additional fees.

Now with joe Point of Sale, Zero Tolerance gets access to a built-in loyalty and automated marketing program.

> "joe is all about coffee, it's all about the coffee experience. Plus I really like the discoverability features to help grow my business."

> "Even I use joe when I travel. With joe, I can see on the app where the independent coffee shops are nearby, and that same method helps bring new customers to my shop."

## Reducing Costs and Building Brand

For this Oklahoma City coffee and cocoa company:
- Nearly 10% of their $15k monthly revenue is attributed to joe's loyalty and rewards program
- More than 50% of their customer base are loyalty customers
- 10% of their customers discover them through the joe network

> "joe, and the entire joe team, cares about me and my business. And our customers love that they are supporting a larger network of independent coffee shops too!"
