Asensio Coffee was juggling multiple systems to run their coffee shop. joe Point of Sale changed everything.

## The Challenge

Before joe, Asensio Coffee was managing:
- Separate POS system
- Separate loyalty program
- Separate mobile ordering

Three systems meant three times the complexity, three times the training, and three times the headaches.

## The Solution

joe Point of Sale consolidated everything into one comprehensive system:
- In-person ordering
- Mobile ordering
- Loyalty and rewards
- Automated marketing

All built specifically for coffee shops.

## The Results

Since switching to joe, Asensio Coffee has:
- Gone from 3 systems to 1
- Simplified barista workflow
- Reduced training time for new staff
- Improved customer experience

The baristas can now focus on what they do best—making great coffee—instead of managing multiple systems.

— Owner, Asensio Coffee
