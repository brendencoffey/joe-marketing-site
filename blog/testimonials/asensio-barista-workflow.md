Alina is the full-time barista at [Asensio Coffee](https://asensiocoffee.com/). Serving delicious coffee and creating meaningful relationships is what she loves most about her job, but often complex systems and long to-do lists get in the way.

Since implementing joe Point of Sale, Asensio Coffee now integrates their in-person and digital orders, simplifying their workflow. So Alina and the other baristas can spend more time fostering community, and less time focusing on tech.
