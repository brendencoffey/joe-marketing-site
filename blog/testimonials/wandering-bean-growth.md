Meet Megan Bondurant, the enterprising owner of The Wandering Bean in Hillsboro, MO. For 3 years, she had a dream of owning a coffee shop and in 2022, she took the plunge into entrepreneurship.

She convinced her friend, Morgan, to leave her retail career path and join her "coffee dream bandwagon". The Wandering Bean opened its doors in August 2022.

## Why Joe Point of Sale?

When Megan was considering point of sale systems, she knew she wanted mobile ordering to differentiate her shop from competitors.

> "I originally planned on using Square and potentially creating a white label app. However, after some research, I stumbled upon Joe Point of Sale that fully integrated in-person and digital orders, included built-in rewards, and automated my marketing. It was too good to be true! It was exactly what I needed for my coffee shop!"

## Coffee Wasn't Convenient, Until The Wandering Bean

Hillsboro is located about 40 minutes outside of St. Louis, with many commuters but few coffee shops. The nearest Starbucks is at least 20 minutes away.

> "When we first opened, we had faithful Starbucks customers thank us, saying 'Our town has needed this coffee shop, and you have made it so convenient that I don't need to go anywhere else!'"

## The Results

- **$18,000** in average monthly revenue
- **2,000+ orders** per month
- **$2,200+** in monthly barista tips
- **30%** of customers converted from in-person to mobile users
- **$5k+** of monthly revenue attributed to joe's loyalty marketing

## Megan's Advice for New Coffee Shop Owners

> "When I opened a coffee shop, I made two of the smartest investments: the first is Morgan, my manager, and the second is Joe. Choosing Joe as your point of sale is 100% a no-brainer. Our shop would not have the sales that we have and the month-over-month growth that we have if it were not for Joe."
