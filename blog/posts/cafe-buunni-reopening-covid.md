*As part of our ongoing effort to empower independent coffee shops with resources, tips and best practices to adapt during the COVID-19 crisis, we are interviewing a series of business owners that are finding ways to safely serve customers and protect baristas.*

## Cafe Buunni Re-opening During COVID

[Cafe Buunni](https://www.buunnicoffee.com/), serving specialty Ethiopian coffee, is centered around celebrating family and community. So when COVID-19 hit New York City, where the 4 Cafe Buunni's are located, it was extremely sad for this team to not do what they loved and serve their community.

We sat down with Sarina Prabasi, co-founder of Buunni Coffee. Sarina totes an experienced coffee resume, including accomplishments as cafe owner, serving on the Board of Advisors for the Specialty Coffee Association, and published author of "The Coffeehouse Resistance."

## COVID-19 in NYC

Suddenly, Sarina and her husband/business partner Elias were faced with extremely difficult decisions based not only on what is right for their business, but also what is right as a human being.

All four of Cafe Buunni's shops are located in Northern Manhattan and the Bronx, which are among the communities hit hardest by COVID-19. New York's Governor Cuomo enacted the "New York State on PAUSE" executive order March 22, 2020, effectively shutting down all non-essential businesses.

Now more than two months in, Cafe Buunni is slowly reopening. This interview centers around their decision to reopen Buunni cafes, the safety measures they've implemented, and how they've continued to serve their community even when their doors were closed.

## Community Highlights

Sarina owes their success to the communities they've built around the cafes. Here are highlights from this discussion:

- Implementing a **Pay-it-Forward** campaign for customers to donate cups of Buunni coffee to frontline workers across the city - *Featured on The TODAY Show*
- Communicating encouraging words to customers whenever - and wherever - possible
- Selling roasted beans and talking with customers about home brewing

## Operational Highlights

Cafe Buunni is opening up doors one cafe at a time for the safety of customers and staff. Sarina mentions several operational changes:

- Implementing joe Mobile Ordering for a contact-free ordering option
- Limiting hours of operations
- Converting the front door to a take out window
- Requiring staff to wear masks throughout the work day
- Simplifying the menu

**Encouraging customers to use joe as the safest form of ordering, Cafe Buunni's first location to reopen is serving about 1/3 of their customers exclusively through joe.**

## Advice for Others

"Discover and believe in your 'Why'. It will get you through good times and bad, whether you're a new business or established."

At joe, it is our mission to empower indie coffee, especially in hard times for small businesses.
