Adding food to your coffee shop menu can really give a boost to your bottom line. After all, offering food can provide opportunities to upsell customers, adding a breakfast burrito or pastry to their coffee order.

But as a coffee shop owner, you know the importance of efficiency and streamlined processes in your workflow and adding new menu offerings shouldn't also add stress to your barista's workflow.

One tool that can help improve your barista's efficiency is a Kitchen Display System (KDS).

## What is a KDS?

A Kitchen Display System (KDS) is a digital screen that displays incoming orders in real-time. It replaces traditional paper tickets, eliminates wasted time, and allows your staff to view orders quickly and accurately, reducing the likelihood of errors and delays.

## Here are 4 reasons why you should add a KDS to your coffee shop:

### 1. Improved Order Accuracy

A KDS helps reduce order errors by displaying orders in real-time, making it easier for your baristas to keep track of what needs to be prepared. joe's barista KDS also includes important order details, visual indicators, and any modifiers or special requests all designed to reduce a barista's cognitive load and ensure orders are prepared correctly the first time.

### 2. Quicker Order Fulfillment

A KDS maximizes your workflow by eliminating the need to physically organize and sort paper tickets. Customizable workflows with joe's barista KDS eliminate the need for staff members to run orders from your point of sale to the kitchen or espresso bar.

Instead, utilize joe's flexible hardware solutions to automatically send orders to the appropriate stations. Your staff can focus more on relationships and preparing quality food and drinks.

### 3. Reduce Waste

KDS can help drastically reduce waste by providing real-time visibility into orders and what needs to be prepared. Built-in features around workflow, such as scheduled orders or chronological ordering queuing reduce the likelihood of food and drink items going to waste.

### 4. Analytics and Reporting

Embracing technology with a KDS behind the bar and in the kitchen can also provide valuable analytics and reporting about your shop's efficiency. With a coffee-specific KDS in your coffee shop, you can track metrics such as order volume and preparation times.

## Real Results
