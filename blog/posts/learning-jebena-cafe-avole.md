## The Art of Ethiopian Coffee

At Cafe Avole, coffee is more than a drink - it's a ceremony, a tradition, and a way of bringing people together.

## What is Jebena?

The jebena is a traditional Ethiopian clay pot used to brew coffee during the coffee ceremony. With its distinctive round bottom and long neck, the jebena represents centuries of coffee tradition from the birthplace of coffee itself.

## The Coffee Ceremony

The Ethiopian coffee ceremony is a ritual of hospitality and community:

1. **Green beans are roasted** right before your eyes, filling the room with incredible aromas
2. **The beans are ground** using a traditional mortar and pestle
3. **Coffee is brewed** in the jebena over hot coals
4. **Three rounds are served**: Abol (first), Tona (second), and Baraka (third)

Each round has its own significance, with the third considered a blessing.

## Why It Matters

In our fast-paced world of quick coffee stops and to-go cups, the Ethiopian coffee ceremony reminds us what coffee can be:
- A reason to slow down
- An excuse to gather with friends and neighbors
- A celebration of craft and tradition
- A moment of genuine human connection
