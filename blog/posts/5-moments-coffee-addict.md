## You Know You're a Coffee Addict When...

Coffee isn't just a beverage - it's a lifestyle. If you're nodding along to these moments, welcome to the club.

## 1. The Pre-Coffee Zombie State

That moment when someone tries to talk to you before your first cup and you can barely form words. Your coworkers have learned: wait until the coffee kicks in.

**The solution**: Order ahead on joe so your coffee is ready the moment you need it.

## 2. The Afternoon Panic

It's 2:47 PM. Your energy is crashing. You need coffee NOW, but the line at your favorite shop is 12 people deep.

**The solution**: Mobile ordering means no line, no waiting, no panic.

## 3. The "Do They Know My Order?" Hope

Walking into your regular spot and hoping they'll start making your usual before you even reach the counter. The joy when they do. The disappointment when they don't.

**The solution**: Save your favorites on joe and reorder with one tap. They'll always know your order.

## 4. The Coffee Shop Loyalty Dilemma

You love your regular shop, but there's a new one you want to try. It feels like cheating somehow.

**The solution**: With joe, your loyalty points work at any shop on the network. Explore without guilt.

## 5. The "Just One More Cup" Negotiation

That internal debate between "I should probably stop" and "but coffee makes everything better." Coffee always wins.

**The solution**: We're not here to judge. Order as many cups as you want.

## Embrace Your Coffee Addiction

Being a coffee addict is nothing to be ashamed of. Download joe and make your addiction more convenient.
