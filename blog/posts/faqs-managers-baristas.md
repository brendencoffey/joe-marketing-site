## Your Questions Answered

We've compiled the most common questions we hear from managers and baristas about implementing joe at their shops.

## Setup & Onboarding

### How long does it take to get started?
Most shops are up and running within 24-48 hours. We handle the menu setup and provide all the training you need.

### Do I need special equipment?
Just a tablet or smartphone to receive orders. iOS or Android both work.

### Is there a contract?
No contracts. You can stop using joe anytime with no penalties.

## Daily Operations

### How do orders come in?
Orders appear on your tablet with a notification. You can accept them immediately or set a prep time.

### What if we get too busy?
You can pause mobile orders anytime, or extend prep times during rushes.

### Can we 86 items?
Yes! You can mark items as unavailable in real-time, and they'll disappear from the customer app.

## Tips & Pay

### Do baristas still get tips?
Absolutely! Mobile orders consistently see higher tip rates than cash transactions.

### When do we get paid?
Payments are deposited to your account within 1-2 business days.

### What are the fees?
Just 9% total, including payment processing. Compare that to 30%+ from delivery apps.
