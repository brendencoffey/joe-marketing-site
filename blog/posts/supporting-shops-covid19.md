## We're Expanding Availability for joe

As more states consider or announce limiting cafes and coffee shops to take-out, we have been overwhelmed with demand. It's incredibly important to us that we step up for coffee business owners at a time when they need us most. As a result, we are making a few short-term adjustments so that we can serve every shop in the U.S.

**First, we are waiving commission for the first 30 days on joe.** During this period, all new partners will only be charged the processing price of 2.9% to serve their customers with order ahead for pickup. Per usual, we do not require any contracts, monthly subscriptions or commitments of any kind. We are a strictly pay-for-performance service. Then, we charge just 9% including processing and continue to invest aggressively in deals and offers to keep you top of mind and maximize your revenue per customer.

**Additionally, we are waiving our setup fees** until the government-placed limitations are lifted. For businesses that don't already have a dedicated iOS or Android tablet that is version 6.0 (Marshmallow) or newer to receive orders, we are providing them at a subsidized cost of $199.

## Getting Started

To launch mobile ordering at your shop, complete the steps below and an account manager will reach out directly with next steps.

1. Register
2. Tell us about your menu
3. Launch as early as later that day!
