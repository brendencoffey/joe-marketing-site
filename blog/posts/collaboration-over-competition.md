## The era of the POS is dead. Long live community!

For years, coffee shop owners like you have viewed their point of sale (POS) simply as a tool to process payments. Meanwhile, Starbucks transformed their tech into a formula that drives almost all revenue growth for the company.

- More people pay using the Starbucks app than use Apple Pay
- Starbucks qualifies as the 10th largest bank based on customer cash card balances
- Their valuation largely reflects their value as a tech company

The key to Starbucks' growth is using technology to leverage their biggest advantage: their scale. With over 30,000 owned and licensed stores in the U.S., they are a convenient option in every neighborhood - heck, sometimes they have more than one location on the same corner.

## Why Scale Matters for Customer Behavior

Why is that a big deal? Because people don't just drink coffee once a day. They consume 3+ times throughout the day with 3 major moments:

- **Breakfast** (or beginning of commute)
- **Late morning** (or before lunch)
- **Early afternoon** (mid afternoon pick-me-up)

When you think about where customers are at each of those moments - in areas where they live, work, and play - it becomes pretty clear: alone, you can only really meet about 1/3 of the need that even your most loyal customers have because they are simply too far away to come to your shop every time.

## Together, We Unlock the Same Advantages

Here's the good news. **Collectively** we can provide a convenient and rewarding option that outperforms what Starbucks is able to offer and customers get the intrinsic reward of supporting another local business.

In every neighborhood, coffee lovers get to experience great coffee shops, earn rewards, and redeem them anywhere.

Alone, none of us can get the same benefits from technology that large chains get from their tech. But together, we do just that and so much more.

## Big Tech Benefits While Keeping Your Independence

As former baristas, we know workflows are critical and when something isn't working - the whole community feels it. It's not enough to add sales and reduce costs. If that growth burns out your baristas, it's not going to last.

Our platform automatically harmonizes orders across sales channels (kiosk, app, web, POS) and drastically reduces time to serve regulars by cutting down data entry at the POS with features like customer favorites for one-tap reordering.

Plus, with a fully integrated loyalty and rewards experience in the app, customers are empowered with tools to purchase and reload gift cards, redeem offers, and manage their rewards so they don't have to do it at the POS during rush hour.

We build your menu, train your team, and even pay for free drinks and discounts for customers. It's all built-in, easy, and designed for owners like you.
