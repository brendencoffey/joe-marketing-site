*As part of our ongoing effort to empower independent coffee shops with resources, tips and best practices to adapt during the COVID-19 crisis, we are interviewing a series of business owners that are finding ways to safely serve customers and protect baristas.*

## How Necessary & Sufficient Prepared for COVID-19

When COVID-19 initially reached the US, Kate Vrijmoet, owner of [Necessary & Sufficient Coffee](https://www.necessary-coffee.com/) didn't wait to make an action plan for her shop. Even though she is located in a neighborhood of Chicago, she had contacts in the Seattle area who were first-hand experiencing the impacts of COVID.

In **early February**, far ahead of the rest of the country, Kate responded. Creating a 5 Phase action plan, she retrained her staff, and modified operations to ensure when the pandemic did reach Chicago, their doors (or rather service window) would be open.

## COVID in Chicago

As Kate describes, in Chicago this pandemic is invisible to a lot of people, however, the threat is entirely real. As owner, she has to take things serious for the safety of her community and the longevity of her business.

## Changes to Operations

First steps that Kate and her team made was creating the shop's **5 Phase Plan**. This plan was posted for the public and detailed the modifications they were making to internal practices, as well as sanitization precautions and changes to operations.

Necessary has a small storefront with a traditional Chicago-style labor workers window. Other changes included:

- Open a second window - one for ordering, one for pick up
- Going cashless and promoting contactless ordering with joe
- Eliminating some programs like the reusable cup discount
- Creating pay-it-forward programs for customers to contribute to
- Adding a filter over windows to protect from airborne transmission

## Building Trust with Staff

Kate's team all commit to a "working agreement" that includes expectations for harmony in the workplace. For staff safety, the team added **amendments** including:

- Taking temperature twice a day
- Following CDC guidelines
- Wearing a mask, gloves, and going above and beyond with sanitizing

Kate also committed to the **mental and emotional wellbeing** of her staff by:

- Doubling down on team meetings each month
- Scheduling all staff for only 4 work days a week
- Refusing service to customers who choose to not wear masks

## Communicating with Customers

A few key highlights include:

- Using positive phrases like "We're happy to serve you when you come back with a mask"
- Keeping masks available for sale at the shop
- Publishing the 5 Phase Plan for the community to view

We are in this together.
