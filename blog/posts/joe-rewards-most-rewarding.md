Starbucks has truly aced the game of creating a devoted fanbase. They cracked the code with a winning formula that included an enticing and gamified rewards program, a trustworthy in-person and digital experience, extremely valuable customer ordering data, and targeted marketing campaigns tailored to their coffee lovers.

Even with superior coffee and service, independent coffee has had to rely on run-of-the-mill point of sale and rewards solutions that simply sent out marketing emails manually, and small businesses were left in the dust.

**But, the tables have turned!** Independent coffee shops can now go head-to-head with corporate giants in terms of rewards and marketing strategies.

## Introducing joe Rewards

joe Rewards is a loyalty and rewards program armed with a marketing powerhouse that brings the same growth formula used by Starbucks right into the hands of small businesses.

Yes, you heard it right! joe Rewards, along with a suite of marketing capabilities and a comprehensive customer relationship management tool, is now accessible to independent coffee shop owners through their joe Coffee app.
