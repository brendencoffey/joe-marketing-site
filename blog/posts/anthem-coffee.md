## Heroic Hospitality at Anthem Coffee

Bryan Reynolds is the CEO of Anthem Coffee Company. He's built a brand on what he calls "Heroic Hospitality". The concept involves going the extra mile to create a lasting impression with customers. He starts with a service mentality and the revenue follows.

We sat down with Bryan to understand how joe fits into his vision of better serving his community and his customers in memorable and exciting ways.

## The Anthem Philosophy

At Anthem Coffee, every interaction is an opportunity to make someone's day better. Bryan and his team believe that:

- **Service comes first**: When you focus on truly serving your customers, the business results follow naturally
- **Community matters**: Anthem is deeply rooted in the South Puget Sound community
- **Excellence is non-negotiable**: From the coffee to the experience, everything must be exceptional

## How joe Fits In
