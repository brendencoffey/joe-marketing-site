## The Branded App Temptation

When coffee shop owners see Starbucks crushing it with their mobile app, the natural instinct is: "I need my own app!" 

It sounds logical. But here's why it almost never works for independent shops.

## The Numbers Don't Lie

### Development Costs
A custom mobile app costs $50,000-$150,000 to build properly. And that's just the start - ongoing maintenance, updates, and bug fixes add thousands more each year.

### The Download Problem
The average smartphone user downloads **zero** new apps per month. Getting customers to find, download, and create an account in yet another app is a massive hurdle.

### The Usage Problem
Even if customers download your app, they probably won't use it. 77% of users never use an app again after 72 hours.

## Why Starbucks Succeeds (And You Can't Copy Them)

Starbucks makes their app work because they have:

- **17,000+ locations** ensuring their app is useful almost everywhere
- **Billions in marketing** to drive downloads
- **Engineering teams** of hundreds of developers
- **Years of iteration** and optimization

## The Better Alternative

Instead of fighting an uphill battle with a branded app, smart indie shops are joining networks like joe:

- **No app for customers to download** - they use the joe app that's already on their phone
- **Network effects** - more shops mean more users, which means more shops
- **Shared development costs** - world-class technology at a fraction of the price
- **Built for coffee** - not a restaurant app shoehorned into coffee

## The Bottom Line

Don't waste your resources trying to build what Starbucks has. Instead, join a network purpose-built for indie coffee. Email success@joe.coffee to learn more.
