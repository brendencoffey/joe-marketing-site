## 5:30am - Walking into your shift...

It's early. You need coffee. It's going to be a busy day. But this is what you're made for. This espresso bar is your kingdom.

## 7:00am - It's starting to get busy...

And you secretly love it. There's nothing quite like the rhythm of a morning rush when you're in the zone.

## 9:00am - That regular strolls in and picks up their drink

They ordered ahead on joe, and *you* had it ready for them. The satisfaction of nailing someone's order before they even walk through the door? Unmatched.

## 11:30am - The rush slows down and you handled it like a pro

You were slinging drinks left and right, serving in-person customers and busting through those mobile orders. Let's face it, you're a beast!

## 12:45pm - Counting your tips & they were 🔥

Since switching to joe Point of Sale, your tips have increased $6.00 per hour. I guess that means it's time to treat yourself!

## 1:15pm - Your work here is done

Serving delicious caffeinated drinks with exceptional customer service. See you tomorrow, folks!
