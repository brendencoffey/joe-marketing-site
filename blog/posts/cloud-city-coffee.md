How this joe partner is prioritizing customer experience above all, viewing coffee shops as a catalyst for community, and their decision to switch to joe from a white-label app.

## Customer Experience First

Cloud City Coffee understands that the coffee shop experience extends beyond the cup. Every touchpoint—from ordering to pickup—matters in building customer loyalty.

## The Switch from White-Label

Like many coffee shops, Cloud City initially considered a white-label mobile ordering app. But they quickly realized the limitations: high costs, limited features, and the burden of promoting their own app.

By switching to joe, Cloud City gained:

- Access to a network of indie coffee lovers
- Lower costs than white-label solutions
- Continuous feature updates without additional investment
- Marketing support to drive adoption

## Results

Since joining joe, Cloud City has seen increased mobile order volume and stronger customer relationships. The decision to prioritize customer experience—and partner with joe—continues to pay off.
