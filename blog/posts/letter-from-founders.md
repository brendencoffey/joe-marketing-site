Dear Coffee Community,

When we started joe, we had a simple but ambitious vision: make buying local coffee as convenient as ordering at Starbucks.

We believed that independent coffee shops offer something special that chains simply can't replicate - community, authenticity, and genuine human connection. But we also knew that these shops were at a disadvantage when it came to technology and convenience.

## Why We Built joe

We saw a problem: coffee lovers wanted to support local shops, but often defaulted to chains because of convenience. Mobile ordering, rewards programs, and seamless payments were features that only big corporations could afford to build.

We asked ourselves: what if we could give independent coffee shops the same technological advantages as Starbucks?

That question led to joe.

## Our Mission

Our mission is simple: help independent coffee shops thrive.

We do this by:
- **Making ordering convenient** - Mobile ordering that rivals any chain
- **Building loyalty** - Rewards programs that keep customers coming back
- **Driving growth** - Automated marketing that works while you sleep
- **Reducing costs** - Technology that improves efficiency and margins

## Where We're Going

We've set an ambitious goal: launch 16,000 locations on the joe platform. Why? Because we believe that when independent coffee shops work together, they can create a network more powerful than any chain.

Imagine walking into any city in America and knowing you can order ahead at a local shop, earn rewards, and enjoy a great experience - all while supporting a small business owner's dream.

That's the future we're building.

## Thank You

To every shop owner who has trusted us with their business - thank you.

To every barista who has embraced our technology - thank you.

To every customer who chooses local - thank you.

We're just getting started, and we're grateful to have you on this journey with us.

Here's to building something special together.

With gratitude,

**Nick & Brenden Martin**
Co-Founders, joe
