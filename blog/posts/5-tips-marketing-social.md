## Social Media Done Right

Your coffee shop probably already has a social media presence. But are you using it to its full potential? Here are five tips to level up your social game.

## 1. Show the Process, Not Just the Product

Customers love seeing behind the scenes:
- Latte art in progress
- Beans being roasted
- Your barista's morning prep routine
- New menu items being tested

**Pro tip**: Stories and Reels get higher engagement than static posts.

## 2. Feature Your Regulars (With Permission)

Your customers are your best marketing:
- Share customer photos of your drinks
- Spotlight your regulars
- Create a hashtag and encourage customers to use it

**Pro tip**: User-generated content feels more authentic than polished marketing.

## 3. Be Consistently Inconsistent

Post regularly, but vary your content:
- Monday: Behind-the-scenes
- Wednesday: Featured drink
- Friday: Customer spotlight
- Weekend: Community vibes

**Pro tip**: Aim for 3-5 posts per week minimum.

## 4. Engage, Don't Just Broadcast

Social media is a conversation:
- Reply to every comment
- Like and comment on customer posts
- Ask questions in your captions
- Run polls and quizzes in stories

**Pro tip**: Engagement in the first hour after posting helps the algorithm.

## 5. Connect Online to Offline

Use social to drive in-store traffic:
- Promote limited-time specials
- Announce when popular items are available
- Share your joe ordering link for mobile customers
- Promote events and collaborations

**Pro tip**: Include a clear call-to-action in every post.

## The Bottom Line

Social media marketing doesn't have to be complicated. Be authentic, be consistent, and let your shop's personality shine through.
