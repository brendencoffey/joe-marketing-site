Most coffee shop loyalty programs look good on the surface—customers earn points, redeem rewards, and come back for more. But here's the catch: **between 8% and 18% of loyalty-attributed sales end up being promotions and comps that coffee shops pay for**. And most of that spend goes toward **rewards on purchases customers were going to make anyway**.

In short, these programs reward repeat behavior but **fail to create new purchasing occasions**.

## How Joe Loyalty is Different

At Joe, we believe loyalty marketing should *drive real growth*, not just give discounts.

### Higher Participation

While traditional programs average 20–30% participation, **Joe's loyalty experiences average 65% participation**. That means nearly **two out of every three customers** are engaging regularly with your loyalty experience.

### Smarter Use of Funds

Rather than asking you to take the risk on how much loyalty costs will be, **Joe sets a flat loyalty marketing rate starting at 6% of revenue**. That fee funds:

- **Reward redemptions and discounts**
- **Targeted marketing** to bring customers back more often

### Universal Rewards Engine

Our platform leverages data from **millions of customer profiles** to:

- Predict who's most likely to increase their spend
- Automatically send **personalized offers** to bring them back
- Maximize **monthly spend per customer** at your shop

You can even choose to increase your loyalty marketing rate to grow more aggressively—we'll do the rest.

## How to Calculate Your Current Loyalty Marketing Budget

To understand your current loyalty marketing performance, here's a simple way to break it down:

### Step 1: Find Your Loyalty-Attributed Revenue

- Go to your **Loyalty or Rewards report** in your POS or reporting dashboard.
- Look for **"Loyalty Attributed Revenue"** — this shows the total sales that occurred through your loyalty program.
- Divide this by your total revenue to find your **loyalty participation rate**
  - For example, if 35% of your total revenue is loyalty attributed, your participation rate is ~35%.
  - Joe partners typically see this number at **65% or higher**.

### Step 2: Find Your Promotions & Comps

- In your **Sales report**, locate the line item for **Promotions and Comps**.
- This is the actual cost of rewards and discounts you've given out.

### Step 3: Calculate Your Promotions Rate

- Divide **Promotions and Comps** by your **Loyalty Attributed Revenue**.
- This gives you your **promotions rate** — the percentage of loyalty-driven sales you're giving away in discounts.

**Example:**
- Loyalty Attributed Revenue = $10,000
- Promotions and Comps = $1,200
- Promotions Rate = $1,200 ÷ $10,000 = **12%**

This means you're spending 12% of your loyalty-driven sales on rewards—**often on orders that would have happened anyway**.

## Why This Matters

The goal of loyalty marketing is simple: **use a fixed budget to generate new customer behavior**—whether that's more frequent visits, larger order sizes, or reactivating lapsed guests.

Joe does this exceptionally well by:

- **Structuring rewards** to maximize incremental purchases
- Using **data-driven predictions** to send the right offers at the right time
- Starting with a low, predictable **6% flat rate** that drives real ROI

We don't just reward loyalty. **We grow it.**
