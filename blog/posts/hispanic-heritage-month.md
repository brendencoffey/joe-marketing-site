September 15 marks the start of Hispanic Heritage Month. We honor and celebrate these Latinx-owned shops on the network, their contributions, and their incredible stories.

## Celebrating Culture Through Coffee

Hispanic and Latinx coffee shop owners bring rich cultural traditions, unique flavor profiles, and vibrant community spaces to the independent coffee scene. From traditional preparations to modern interpretations, these shops showcase the diversity and depth of Hispanic coffee culture.

## Supporting Latinx-Owned Businesses

This month, we encourage you to discover and support Latinx-owned coffee shops in your community. Their stories of entrepreneurship, family traditions, and community building are at the heart of what makes independent coffee special.

Use joe to order ahead at Latinx-owned coffee shops and show your support during Hispanic Heritage Month and beyond.
