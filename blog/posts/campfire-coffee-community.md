Quincy and his wife Whitni's story of starting Campfire Coffee captures the essence of what community coffee is all about.

Just a few years into their journey and they're already a beloved brand in their hometown of Tacoma and a champion for local business in the community.

They invest thousands of dollars every year back into the community in the form of bikes, hiking shoes, and are the first ones to show up to support a cause.

## Turning Setback Into Catalyst

Last week, their business was targeted by vandals not once, but twice in just two days with damage costing thousands of dollars. Not to mention the lost income from having to close up shop to make the repairs.

If you're in coffee, you know this is THE slowest time of year and the already-tight margins are being squeezed by rising costs. So, for most owners this would be a devastating setback... but not for Quincy and Whitney...

**Instead of letting the setback bring them down, they are using it as a catalyst for community.**

## A Different Kind of Fundraiser

Over the weekend, the couple kicked off a GoFundMe campaign. But, here's the catch. They aren't just looking out for themselves.

They are transforming the setback into a catalyst for community and **setting aside money on every donation to invest in bikes, hiking shoes, and running shoes for youth that can't afford it.**

## How You Can Contribute

1. **Donate to the GoFundMe Campaign**
2. **Purchase a Gift Card via joe**
3. **Buy a coffee subscription**

This is what community coffee is all about. When one of us faces adversity, we come together. When we have an opportunity to give back, we take it.

You can break windows, but you can't break spirit. ☕💪
