Fall is here, and we're excited to announce **new weekly challenges** to help you discover more great coffee and earn rewards!

## What Are Challenges?

Challenges are fun, engaging ways to explore the joe network while earning bonus rewards. Each week, we'll introduce new challenges that encourage you to:

- **Try new drinks** you might not have ordered before

## Why We Love Challenges

Challenges aren't just about rewards—they're about discovery. We've seen customers find their new favorite coffee shop, fall in love with a drink they'd never tried before, and become regulars at places they didn't even know existed.

That's the magic of community coffee. Every shop has something unique to offer, and challenges help you experience it all.
