Whether you're a first-time coffee shop owner, or an experienced coffee professional, choosing the right point of sale system for your shop is vital for running a profitable coffee business.

Your point of sale is more than a tool to process credit card transactions. It is an engine integral to your barista workflow, converting first time customers to loyal regulars, and ultimately growing your business.

## It Empowers Your Baristas

Baristas are the backbone of your coffee shop, representing your brand, crafting your coffee, and interacting with your customers. So your point of sale should empower them, not hinder them.

A point of sale that is user friendly and easy to navigate lets baristas focus more on creating a great customer interaction and less on processing a transaction.

Consider a point of sale with features that will help reduce your barista's cognitive load:
- Sticky paper printers eliminate wasted time writing orders on cups
- Visual indicators on orders help baristas track what's needed
- Flexible hardware solutions automatically send food orders to food stations

**Bonus!** Did you know that joe Point of Sale's smart tipping feature increases barista's tips by nearly $6 per hour?

## It Includes Brand Building Tools

As a busy coffee shop owner, your point of sale should work not only for you but also *for your brand*. Brand building opportunities to consider include:
- Digital ordering
- A robust rewards program made for coffee
- Loyalty marketing to re-engage customers

### Built-in is Best for Coffee

Subscription based programs, such as Toast's or Square's Marketing Emails, are often enticing to coffee shop owners *but* are both costly and time consuming. Users have to draft, send, and optimize those emails manually.

At joe, we'll never penalize you for growth. joe Point of Sale includes built-in brand tools that are optimized for you automatically.

## It's Priced Right

Coffee shops process hundreds of transactions every day. So an affordable point of sale, with transparent pricing is a must.

Joe is built specifically for coffee and offers an industry-low processing rate. Beyond transaction rates, consider other business costs:
- Cost of hardware
- Setup fees
- Software fees
- Monthly subscriptions

Fees can quickly add up with systems like Square or Toast when coffee shops add on important tools for growth.

## It Grows Your Business *for You*

A point of sale is more than credit card processing. It is a tool integral to the experience in your coffee shop, converting first-time visitors to loyal regulars, and ultimately growing your bottom line – all without you having to do extra work!

With joe Point of Sale on your side, we'll streamline your barista workflow, automate loyalty marketing with the right message at the right time, reduce costs, and ultimately grow your small business.
