Over the past few weeks, we've been diving deep into what it means to create and exchange value in independent coffee. At Joe, our mission is not just to provide better technology for coffee shop owners, but to fundamentally shift paradigms that have held independent coffee back from realizing its full potential.

## A Conversation with Quincy Henry of Campfire Coffee

A pivotal moment in these discussions was our conversation with Quincy Henry of Campfire Coffee. Quincy is more than a coffee entrepreneur—he holds a PhD on how art entrepreneurs create and exchange value in digital economies.

As one of fewer than a dozen Black roasters in the U.S., he's pioneering a new approach to coffee that transcends traditional boundaries. His philosophy is rooted in using coffee as a conduit to reconnect people with the earth and the outdoors, making the experience more than just a daily habit—it's about grounding, community, and connection.

Quincy's roasting style embodies this ethos. Beyond coffee, he's also a two-time Grammy nominee, and he leverages his experience as an independent musician to inform how he approaches his business.

## Key Learning: Two Paradigms We Must Change

To unlock the value for indie coffee as a whole, we must collectively change two paradigms:

### 1. For Coffee Shop Owners
The industry must move from viewing a point of sale as a tool for simply accepting payments to understanding it as the **primary growth driver** of their business. This is how Starbucks approaches technology—it's not just a backend function, but a key enabler of customer engagement, revenue growth, and operational efficiency.

### 2. For Consumers
We need to move from the mindset that independent coffee shops are a luxury for when time allows, to a new understanding that independent coffee is **just as convenient and accessible** as corporate giants like Starbucks.

The key to expanding the market is ensuring that when a customer prefers local coffee, there are no barriers—technological or operational—that prevent them from choosing it.
