We've recently launched updates to our joe Mobile Ordering consumer app that make the ordering and pickup experience more intuitive and easier to use.

## What's New

Our team has been hard at work improving the joe experience for both coffee lovers and coffee shop partners. Here are the highlights from our June release:

### Enhanced Ordering Flow

We've streamlined the ordering process to make it faster and more intuitive. Fewer taps mean you get to your coffee sooner.

### Improved Pickup Experience

Clear pickup instructions and real-time order status updates help ensure a smooth handoff every time.

### Better Shop Discovery

Finding new coffee shops in your area is now easier than ever with improved search and filtering options.

## Thank You

These improvements are possible because of feedback from our amazing community of coffee lovers and coffee shop partners. Keep the feedback coming!
