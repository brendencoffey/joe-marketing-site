Here's a quick guide of how Stripe sends funds to your account when you receive payments through joe:

## How Payouts Work

When a payment is made through Stripe, the funds are first processed and held briefly before being sent to your bank account. This short processing window helps ensure the payment fully clears and protects your business against refunds or chargebacks.

Stripe then transfers funds based on your payout schedule:

**Daily Payouts (POS-only partners)**
Funds are sent every *business day* for payments made a few days prior. This is the default schedule for most Point of Sale partners unless adjusted with your Partner Growth Consultant.

**Weekly Payouts (OS partners)**
This schedule is common for mobile-only partners.

## Holiday & Weekend Timing

Stripe only processes payouts on business days, which means weekends and federal banking holidays do not count toward processing or transfer windows. Any payout that would normally fall on a weekend or holiday will instead be initiated on the next available business day.

**Example:**

If your payout speed is T+2 (two business days after the sale) and your schedule is daily:

- A payment made on Monday will typically reach your bank on Wednesday
- A payment made on Tuesday will arrive Thursday
- A payment made on Friday will be processed on Monday (or Tuesday if Monday is a holiday)

Stripe's holiday schedule follows standard U.S. federal banking holidays, so delays are expected during closures such as New Year's Day, MLK Day, Presidents' Day, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and others observed by the banking system.

## Looking Ahead

We know holiday delays can be a frustration, and we're actively working on optimizations in the new year to make payout timing even smoother! Stay tuned for updates.
