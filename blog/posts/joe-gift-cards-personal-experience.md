At joe, we're shaking things up in the world of coffee shop rewards and gift cards. Our new joe Rewards Cards that's backed by an entire suite of marketing capabilities gives indie coffee shops a competitive edge and industry giants like Starbucks a run for their money.

joe Rewards Cards go beyond traditional coffee shop gifting. With joe Rewards, we're bringing the Starbucks Rewards' formula for growth to your independent coffee shop to build your coffee brand, incentivize customers to become loyal regulars, and kickstart growth.

## Revolutionizing Brand Building with Rewards Cards

joe Rewards cards are completely customizable, allowing you to showcase your coffee shop's unique brand, whether they're sitting on your cafe counter or being redeemed digitally through the joe Coffee App.

You can choose from our pre-designed options or let your creativity shine and create your own unique design!

These rewards cards are far from your average gift cards. Thanks to the power of joe Rewards, these cards bring the technology and strategy of Starbucks Rewards cards and put them in your hand.

Just like Starbucks, your customers can order in-person or can order ahead using their gift card balance, plus view their balance and reload directly from the joe app.

## Rewards Customers Get All The Perks

Being a joe Rewards member comes with serious perks! Customers get to enjoy a seamless and personalized checkout experience that caters to their coffee routine. They have the freedom to choose their preferred payment method:

- Swipe the physical Rewards card
- Enter their Rewards phone number and PIN for digital payment
- Simply use the joe Coffee app for quick on-the-go orders

With the joe Coffee App, they'll have the power to effortlessly keep tabs on their balance and rewards earned. Need to top up your balance in a flash? No worries, we've got you covered.

As a member of joe Rewards, customers:
- Earn points at lightning speed
- Join in on exciting weekly bonus point challenges
- Unlock exclusive discounts, deals, and a whole lot more

## Coming Soon: Deals to Encourage Customers to Join

A simple yet super effective method that Starbucks uses to foster loyalty among their customers is by providing incentives for customers who upload money to their Starbucks Rewards account.

Soon, we'll be launching a newly improved Merchant Manager, complete with the new Marketing Tab, where you can create and offer the same types of incentives to your customers!

For instance, you can reward customers with $75 when they upload $60 to their Rewards card, or $125 when they upload $100, making their loyalty even more rewarding.
