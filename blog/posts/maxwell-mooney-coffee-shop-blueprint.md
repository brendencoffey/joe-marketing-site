## Advice For Coffee Shop Owners

### 1. Efficiency & Workflow Optimization
- Rising labor costs mean every second counts
- Using tools like spaghetti maps and step counting can help find inefficiencies
- Tech-driven automation can ease the burden on labor while increasing throughput

### 2. Pricing & Margin Management
- Understanding emotional price anchors: Owners often underprice their products
- Strategic price increases are necessary for premium experiences
- Quarterly pricing audits help ensure margin benchmarks are met

### 3. Volume is Key to Profitability
- Coffee shops are low-margin, high-volume businesses
- Expanding digital ordering, subscriptions, and pre-orders helps increase volume
- Incremental purchases & cross-selling drive more frequent purchases

### 4. Leveraging Data & Technology for Growth
- The right POS, loyalty, and ordering systems should be an investment that drives growth
- Centralized loyalty programs shift focus from discounts to increasing purchase frequency

### 5. Community & Market Positioning
- Aligning with local-first values resonates with customers
- Collaboration, not competition: Local coffee shops can compete by working together

### Final Takeaway

The independent coffee shop community is stronger together—owners should rethink their tech strategy, pricing approach, and marketing tactics to scale collectively.
