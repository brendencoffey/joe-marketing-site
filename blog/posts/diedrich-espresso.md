## Diedrich Espresso Chooses joe

Diedrich Espresso made the switch from third-party delivery apps to joe - and they haven't looked back.

## The Problem with Third-Party Apps

Delivery apps like UberEats and DoorDash might seem convenient, but they come with serious downsides:

- **30%+ commission fees** that crush already-thin margins
- **No customer data** - the platform owns the relationship
- **Quality control issues** - your drink sits in a car for 20 minutes
- **Brand dilution** - you become just another option in an endless scroll

## The joe Difference

joe was built specifically for coffee shops that want to own their customer relationships:

- **9% total fee** including payment processing
- **You own your customer data** and relationships
- **Made for pickup** - drinks are served fresh, the way you intended
- **Your brand, your customers** - we help you grow, not compete with you

## Why Diedrich Made the Switch

Diedrich Espresso realized that giving 30% of their revenue to a third party wasn't sustainable. With joe, they:

- Keep more of what they earn
- Build direct relationships with customers
- Offer the same mobile convenience
- Maintain quality control over every drink
