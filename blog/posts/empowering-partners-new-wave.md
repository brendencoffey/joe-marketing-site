## The New Wave of Coffee

Coffee is experiencing a renaissance. The third wave brought us appreciation for origin, process, and craft. Now, a new wave is emerging - one that combines that appreciation with technology that actually serves the coffee community.

## At the Crossroads

We live at the intersection of:

- **Culture**: Coffee shops are cultural hubs, gathering places for creatives, entrepreneurs, and community builders
- **Art**: Every cup is crafted with care, from sourcing to roasting to brewing
- **Technology**: Mobile ordering and digital payments are reshaping how we interact with our favorite shops
- **Coffee**: At the heart of it all, the pursuit of the perfect cup

## Our Mission

joe exists to empower independent coffee shops with the tools they need to thrive in this new landscape. We believe that:

- **Local shops deserve better**: For too long, technology has been built for chains, not independents
- **Community matters**: The coffee shop is a vital third place that strengthens neighborhoods
- **Convenience shouldn't compromise quality**: Mobile ordering should enhance the coffee experience, not diminish it

## Empowering Partners

Every coffee shop that joins joe becomes part of something bigger:

- A network of indie shops that collectively rival the convenience of national chains
- A community of owners and baristas sharing best practices
- A movement to keep coffee local and keep money in communities

## Join the New Wave

The future of coffee is being written right now. Join us in building a world where indie coffee thrives.
