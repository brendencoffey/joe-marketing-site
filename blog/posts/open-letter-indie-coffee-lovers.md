*An open letter to small business enthusiasts and indie coffee lovers everywhere amid the COVID-19 Pandemic:*

Hi there,

First and foremost, I hope you and your loved ones are well, staying healthy, and finding community during this time of physical distancing.

I felt it was important to reach out to you directly. As a joe user and small business supporter, I know you care about the coffee shop owners and community that help bring some normalcy during this pandemic. I personally have been incredibly disheartened to see major mobile ordering and delivery services exploiting independent businesses that rely on these services more now than ever. I'm sure you've heard the stories as well. **I want you to know that we are not that kind of company.**

Growing up, my family ran a small business to put food on the table. We didn't make much money, but there was a tremendous sense of pride and dignity that came with that independence and self-determination. When a bigger company came to town and put us out of work, it lit a fire in me and my brother to stand up for small businesses and this led us to launch joe.

**We are doing everything we can to step up for indie coffee shops across the nation.**

When stay at home orders were originally issued, **we immediately waived our commission for coffee shops until May 1st.** Then, instead of resuming our already low 9% fee, which includes payment processing and deals for customers like yourself (compared to 30% or more for major meal delivery services), we cut our commissions dramatically so that small business owners can put more money into their pockets to help keep their businesses open during these uncertain times.

As more coffee shops re-open on the joe network with contactless pickup and curbside service, I hope it means something to you that the independent coffee shop you are supporting is getting their fair share of the earnings. It means everything to me.

Thank you for choosing to support small business.

Sincerely,

Nick Martin
Co-Founder | CEO
joe
