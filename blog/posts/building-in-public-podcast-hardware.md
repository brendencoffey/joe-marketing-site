Hello, Community!

Brenden and I are super excited to kick off a raw, unfiltered, and radically authentic initiative we're calling "Building in Public"!

This series pulls back the curtain on our day-to-day and invites the community in to collaborate, share ideas, offer inspiration, and identify ways that together we can harness community and technology to advance our collective prosperity.

**Why?** Because we realize that to change paradigms and transform an industry, you have to build trust. It's hard to trust what you can't see.

## Why We're Making This Leap Now

**The DATA!**

For 2.5 years we have patiently and methodically rolled out feature after feature to build all the essential tools you would expect from a conventional POS. Now, we're working to shift gears from just building product and growing through referrals (we've grown 200% YoY!) to beginning to reach out to shops and begin investing in growth for the first time in a long time.

We're seeing that many owners (early adopters) resonate with what we're doing right away. But to achieve our goal of transforming the industry, we need to reach everyone.

## New Hardware Updates

Syed at DownPour Coffee was the very first partner to upgrade from the previous generation of hardware to the new Terminal experience. Doesn't he look like a proud coffee tech dad here?

## Industry Night Series

As part of our mission, it's essential we build real community in every market. We kicked off our Industry Night series in Tacoma in December and followed up with another in January featuring a latte art throwdown, giveaways, music and food.

Sharing space with coffee pros was a revitalizing experience and carried us through the holidays.

## Coming Soon: Kiosk Experience

We're putting the final touches on our Kiosk experience which is designed to complement coffee workflows in some unique ways and works seamlessly with our coffee-specific order management screen which is proving to free up baristas in some exciting new ways.

Consider this a teaser for our next update...
