You’re brewing great coffee. Your shop is buzzing. But when you check your numbers, they don’t add up.

If you’ve ever asked yourself, *“Why am I working so hard and still not taking home more?”*—you’re not alone. At joe, we work with hundreds of independent coffee shops, and we hear this all the time.

The good news? The problem isn’t you—it’s likely a few hidden inefficiencies in your operation that can be fixed with the right strategy and tools.

## **☕ 1. Food Costs: Raise Prices, Protect Margins, Stay in Business**

**💡 Benchmark:** Beverage costs should be **20% or less** of the menu price. Signature drinks that require more prep or premium ingredients should deliver **even higher margins**.

**What’s going wrong:**
Many shops hold off on raising prices when supplier costs rise, fearing they’ll alienate loyal customers. But pricing discipline is essential for sustainability. It really does all start with the profit per cup. Give yourself permission to run a healthy business - you won't regret it! 

**Common Mistakes:**

* Underpricing drinks that take longer to make


* Avoiding price increases despite rising costs


* Using printed menus that make updates hard



**Best Practices:**

* Track drink-level cost ratios monthly


* Use 

  **digital menus**

   (QR codes, kiosks, apps, and displays) to stay flexible


* Be transparent with customers—loyal guests will understand



**How joe helps:**
With joe, you can instantly update prices across all digital menus—mobile, kiosk, and online. Stay in control of your margins without printing a single menu.

## **🧑‍🍳 2. Labor Costs: Hidden Inefficiencies That Drive Up Payroll**

**💡 Benchmark:** Labor should sit between **25–30% of revenue**.

More staff doesn’t always mean better service. One of the biggest drivers of excess labor cost? **Workflow inefficiencies.**

When baristas spend time punching in modifiers, explaining loyalty programs, or navigating poor layouts, you’re paying for low-value tasks that add no revenue.

**Common Mistakes:**

* Overstaffing based on intuition instead of sales data


* Baristas tied up in repetitive data entry or status updates


* Labor-intensive items not priced for the time they take


* Poor layout slowing down drink production



**Best Practices:**

* Schedule based on sales patterns and dayparts


* Train teams for speed and task prioritization


* Optimize layout and tools to boost return on labor investment


* Audit labor-to-sales ratio regularly



**How joe helps:**
joe automates loyalty, reorders, and order communication across kiosk, app, pos, and online—so your team can focus on what matters. Our workflow tools reduce manual entry and keep lines moving, improving both team morale and profit per labor hour.

## **⚙️ 3. Workflow Inefficiencies: Crush the Rush or Lose the Moment**

Your rush is your biggest opportunity—but only if your team can move fast and efficiently.

**The real killer?** Tech and systems not built for the precision and speed of a coffee workflow.

**Common Mistakes:**

* Time-intensive order entry at the register


* Customers managing loyalty in line, not in the app


* Lack of queue visibility for batching or prioritizing


* Inconsistent workflows between bar and kitchen


* Prep-heavy items that don’t return enough to justify labor



**Best Practices:**

* Empower customers to order ahead and manage loyalty perks via 

  **mobile, online, or kiosk**




* Use tech designed specifically for 

  **coffee shop operations**




* Standardize food and drink prep to speed up throughput


* Automate pickup and order-ready notifications



**How joe helps:**
joe centralizes all orders—from every channel—into one seamless queue with full visibility. Loyalty is handled in the app, reorders are a tap away, and batching tools help your team **crush the rush** while delighting customers. Less chaos, more flow, and way better tips.

## **🎯 4. Loyalty Programs: If It’s Not Growing Sales, It’s Not Working**

**💡 Benchmark:** Loyalty program costs typically run **8–15% of revenue for coffee shops**—so they should be delivering **at least that much in sales growth**.

Too often, shops treat loyalty like a checkbox. If you’re giving away drinks but not seeing measurable growth in return visits or average tickets, something’s off.

**Common Mistakes:**

* Using outdated “punch card” logic with no performance tracking


* No including subscriptions as part of the total program cost


* Spending without measuring revenue impact



**Best Practices:**

* Design loyalty to 

  **drive behavior**

   (larger orders, return visits)


* Set and monitor ROI goals


* Use automated offers to personalize and optimize



**How joe helps:**
joe’s **Universal Offers Engine** is built to drive growth and is subscription-free. It intelligently targets offers to the right customers to increase order size, visit frequency, and total revenue. And it gives you the data to prove it.

## **🏠 5. Fixed Costs: They Hurt Most When Business Slows Down**

**The reality:** Rent, software, and subscriptions don’t care if sales dip. They stay the same—even when your foot traffic drops.

**Common Mistakes:**

* Paying for bloated software stacks you’re not using


* Locking into subscriptions that don’t flex with revenue


* Forgetting to audit costs during the off-season



**Best Practices:**

* Choose 

  **performance-based pricing**

   whenever possible


* Streamline tools to only those that deliver ROI


* Reevaluate tech costs at least once per year



**How joe helps:**
