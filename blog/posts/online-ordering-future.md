The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated online ordering adoption by years. What was once a nice-to-have is now essential for independent coffee shops.

## The Shift is Permanent

Consumer behavior has fundamentally changed. Customers who discovered the convenience of mobile ordering during the pandemic aren't going back. They expect the ability to order ahead, skip the line, and pick up seamlessly.

## Why Online Ordering Works for Coffee

Coffee is uniquely suited to mobile ordering:

- **High frequency** - Coffee is a daily habit for many
- **Low complexity** - Most customers have a regular order
- **Time-sensitive** - Customers want their coffee quickly
- **Habit-forming** - Once customers use mobile ordering, they stick with it

## The Opportunity for Indie Coffee

Independent coffee shops that embrace online ordering can:

- Capture customers who would otherwise default to chains
- Increase order frequency among existing customers
- Boost average ticket sizes
- Build stronger customer relationships through loyalty

Online ordering isn't the future—it's already here. The question is whether you'll embrace it.
