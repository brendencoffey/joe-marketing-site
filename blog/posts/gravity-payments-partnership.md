## Standing Up for Indie Coffee

**We launched joe to stand up for independent business owners.** When we heard that Square was increasing rates for coffee shop owners in our network, we knew we had to do something. A $.10 flat fee per transaction on small average tickets isn't just a headache - it can threaten livelihoods of owners.

We've partnered with [Gravity Payments](https://gravitypayments.com/) to extend our #1 rated mobile ordering and loyalty experience into a **game-changing in-person payment solution which we'll be releasing this spring**. Together, our partnership allows us to lower rates and maximize revenue growth for our partners like never before.

Together, we can level the playing field against national chains. This is the next step.
