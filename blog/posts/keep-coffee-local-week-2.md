In this Week 2 recap of our Keep Coffee Local campaign, we're spotlighting five more business owners behind our customers' favorite local coffee shops, and celebrating how they go above and beyond.

## Featured Shops

Each of these shop owners demonstrates what it means to go the extra mile for their customers and communities. From creative pandemic adaptations to community support initiatives, these entrepreneurs show that independent coffee is about so much more than coffee.

## Going Above & Beyond

What sets independent coffee shops apart is their willingness to go above and beyond. They know their customers by name. They adapt to community needs. They support local causes.

## Support Local Coffee

The Keep Coffee Local campaign celebrates these incredible entrepreneurs. Join us by visiting your favorite local coffee shop—and discovering new ones—this month.
