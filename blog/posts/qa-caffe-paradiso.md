## Growing with joe: Caffe Paradiso's Story

Caffe Paradiso has become one of the most successful shops on the joe network. We sat down with their team to learn their secrets.

## Q: What made you decide to try joe?

"We were looking for a way to serve our customers better during busy times. Lines were getting long, and we could see people leaving. joe seemed like a solution that would help without changing who we are."

## Q: How was the setup process?

"Surprisingly easy. The joe team handled most of it. They built our menu, trained our staff, and we were live within a couple of days. There wasn't a lot of disruption to our normal operations."

## Q: What results have you seen?

"The numbers speak for themselves:
- Higher average tickets on mobile orders
- More frequent visits from our regulars
- New customers discovering us through the app
- Our baristas love the better tips"

## Q: Has it changed how you operate?

"In the best ways. During rushes, we can actually manage the flow better because mobile orders come in ahead of time. Our baristas have more time to focus on quality and connecting with customers instead of just taking orders."

## Q: Any advice for other shop owners?

"Don't overthink it. We were worried about technology changing our vibe, but it actually enhanced it. Our regulars love the convenience, and new customers who find us on joe often become regulars themselves."

## Q: What's next for Caffe Paradiso?

"We're focused on growing our loyal customer base through the rewards program. The data joe provides helps us understand our customers better and make smarter decisions."
