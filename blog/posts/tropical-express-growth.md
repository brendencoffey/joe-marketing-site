## Overview: Bringing the Tropics to Central Washington

Located in the desert of Central Washington, Tropical Express is known for delivering vibrant tropical vibes, fruit-filled flavors, and delicious coffee. Founded in 2017 by Jose Rodriguez and his wife, the brand quickly gained a loyal customer base with multiple drive-thru shops.

However, long wait times posed an operational challenge, leading Jose to make a crucial decision to switch to joe Operating System (OS), integrating in-person ordering, mobile ordering, and built-in rewards.

## The Challenge: Finding a Coffee-Specific OS Solution

When selecting a point-of-sale system, Jose and his team sought a solution tailored to coffee businesses. After extensive research, they found that many available POS systems were designed primarily for restaurants.

> "Many other systems have a broader focus, and we felt like they were more tailored for restaurants and food service. But joe really focused on coffee shops and the functions coffee shops will need and use."

## The Solution: Seamless Onboarding and Workflow Optimization

Jose initially worried that transitioning would be a lengthy process after using their prior system for years. However, with the help of a dedicated Account Manager, the onboarding process was completed in just one day.

> "Our team was thrilled with how seamlessly joe integrated into our existing workflow. We are now able to take orders faster and more accurately, which has resulted in reduced wait times at our drive-thrus."

## The Results

### Digital Rewards Program Transformation

Previously, Tropical Express relied on physical punch cards. The transition to joe OS's digital rewards system dramatically improved customer engagement.

> "Our customers appreciate being able to conveniently track their rewards digitally, eliminating the need to search for and potentially misplace their punch card."

### Mobile Ordering for Greater Convenience

> "Mobile ordering has been huge for us! It has really helped us reduce our wait times in our drive-thru, especially for bigger orders."

Tropical Express now serves an average of 30+ mobile orders per day at each location.

### Jose's Verdict

> "Switching over to joe has been one of the best decisions I have made for my business."
