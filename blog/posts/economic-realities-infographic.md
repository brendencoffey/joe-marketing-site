Independent coffee shop owners are facing unprecedented challenges in today's economic climate. We surveyed coffee shop owners across the country to understand how rising costs, labor shortages, and economic uncertainty are impacting their businesses.

## Key Findings

### Rising Costs Hit Hard

Coffee shop owners report significant increases in:
- **Coffee bean prices** - Supply chain disruptions and climate impacts
- **Milk and dairy** - Inflation affecting all dairy products
- **Labor costs** - Minimum wage increases and competition for workers
- **Rent** - Commercial real estate prices climbing

### Labor Challenges

Finding and retaining quality baristas remains one of the biggest challenges:
- Competition from larger chains offering higher wages
- Burnout from understaffing
- Training costs for new hires
- Scheduling flexibility demands

### Recession Concerns

Many owners express concern about potential economic downturn:
- Customers may cut back on discretionary spending
- Coffee shop visits could decrease
- Pressure to keep prices competitive despite rising costs

## How Coffee Shops Are Adapting

Despite these challenges, independent coffee shops are finding creative solutions:

1. **Embracing Technology** - Using tools like joe to automate marketing and increase efficiency

## The Silver Lining

While challenges are real, independent coffee shops have advantages:
