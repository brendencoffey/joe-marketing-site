## Meet Surfer's Coffee

For most independent coffee shops, service and community through coffee is at the heart of their mission. But what is often overlooked is how the barista experience behind the bar impacts the exceptional customer experience they are striving to create.

For Kayla-Raine Franks of Surfers Coffee in Wahiawa, Hawaii, an inefficient workflow was hurting their cafe experience.

> "We didn't even realize how inefficient our workflow was before upgrading to joe Point of Sale!"

## Optimizing Workflow Efficiency

Surfers is set up with one barista at the hot bar and another at their cold bar for iced drinks and their famous acai bowls, but it required a runner to deliver orders to the right part of the kitchen.

Working with her joe success manager, Kayla-Raine added two bluetooth printers to their workflow, automatically sending the right items to the right station.

> "Now we're able to care more for our baristas and more for our customers because we have the energy for it!"

> "Our workflow is so much more streamlined with joe. The baristas are able to pump through making drinks, and we're able to serve so many more customers."

## Effortlessly Serving More

> "We've definitely noticed our baristas are happier and more motivated since adopting joe POS. They are seeing growth, and having more meaningful conversations, all without adding to their workload."

And their tips have benefited too, increasing 33% in just four months from $6K to $8K per month.

> "It's been great to see new customers go from being a burden on baristas to a blessing."

Since upgrading to joe Point of Sale and optimizing efficiency, Surfers has added $12K in revenue each month—an 18% increase.

> "I don't think we would be here financially if our workflow was still in the same spot it was before adopting joe POS."
