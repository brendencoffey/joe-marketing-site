Ashli Hernandez is the owner of The Coffeehouse at Brookside, an independent coffee shop and retail shop in Ellisville, MS.

With a robust inventory of merchandise and gifts, Ashli uses Square to track and scan all SKU items, but was seeking an order ahead experience better than Square online ordering for her coffee customers.

## The Solution: joe + Square Integration

Integrating joe directly into their existing Square point-of-sale, Ashli was able to:
- Offer her customers another ordering option
- Maximize her barista's workflow
- Get launched in as little as 24 hours

## The Results

Meeting with her Account Manager for a 6-month growth consultation:

> "Getting started on joe was so seamless thanks to their best practices and our account manager who walked us through everything. We got orders right away, and now 6 months in we are seeing $2,500 per month in additional sales through joe!"

In just 6 months joe has become an integral part of The Coffeehouse at Brookside's business. Their baristas have a more efficient workflow, they are able to better serve customers, and Ashli is exploring additional growth options with her joe Account Manager.
