joe has raised a new round of funding as we step up to do more for indie coffee shops everywhere.

## Investing in Independent Coffee

This funding allows us to:

- **Expand our team** to better support coffee shop partners
- **Enhance our technology** with new features and improvements
- **Grow our network** to connect more coffee lovers with independent shops
- **Increase marketing** to drive more customers to local coffee

## Our Mission Continues

From the beginning, joe has been about leveling the playing field for independent coffee shops. This funding accelerates our ability to deliver on that mission.

## Thank You

We're grateful to our investors who share our vision, our coffee shop partners who trust us with their businesses, and the coffee lovers who choose local every day.

The best is yet to come. Let's build coffee together.
