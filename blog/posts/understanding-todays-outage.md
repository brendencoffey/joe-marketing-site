Earlier today, a **major global outage at Cloudflare** caused disruptions across hundreds of platforms—including ours. This incident temporarily impacted both **joe Point of Sale partners** and **mobile ordering partners**, resulting in periods where orders couldn't be accepted or processed.

Cloudflare, which provides critical internet infrastructure relied on by organizations worldwide, confirmed the issue as a large-scale network outage affecting systems across multiple regions.
