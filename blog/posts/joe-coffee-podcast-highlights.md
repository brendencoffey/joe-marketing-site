In this episode, the Joe Coffee founders reflect on the past few months of rapid change, challenges, and alignment as they navigate building a purpose-driven tech company. Here are the standout highlights:

## 🚀 Mario's Rise to Head of Product

A major moment of celebration centered around Mario's promotion. Starting in account management, he consistently took initiative, solved hard problems, and aligned deeply with the company's mission—all without being asked. His journey embodies the kind of leadership Joe Coffee wants to scale.

## ⚠️ Hardware Crisis and Operational Pivot

The team faced a critical challenge when hundreds of tablets failed post-deployment due to aging hardware. Rather than patch over it, they paused all launches for nearly five months—sacrificing short-term revenue to protect long-term quality and trust.

## 🤝 Building a Team Aligned with Purpose

The conversation repeatedly returned to values-aligned hiring. "Culture fit" isn't about personality—it's about shared commitment to building regenerative systems and showing up with integrity. Mario's example is now the bar for hiring.

## 💡 Regenerative Commerce as Strategy

Joe Coffee is pushing beyond conventional startup goals. The team views their work through the lens of regenerative commerce—creating infrastructure that supports small businesses, enables creative expression, and unlocks more equitable participation across the coffee supply chain.

## 💬 Speaking Truth to Power at Stripe

Ahead of a talk with Stripe's founders, the team wrestled with how to describe Joe. The tension between reducing their story to a "coffee POS app" versus telling the deeper truth about their mission created anxiety—but they chose authenticity. The result was clarity, impact, and pride.

## 🌱 Intentional Growth Over Fast Growth

With new funding in sight, the team stressed the importance of staying grounded. Who they hire, who they take money from, and how they scale are all guided by purpose—not ego or pressure.

## 🔄 Agility Through Alignment

From reorgs to onboarding five new team members, the past 60 days were described as "dense." Yet the team maintained momentum by staying agile, rooted in values, and empowering people to lead within their domains.

## 🌍 Bigger Than Coffee

At its core, Joe isn't just about coffee. It's about creating systems of mutual prosperity that serve people—from farmers to baristas to consumers. The team believes their model can help reshape capitalism—one shop, one decision at a time.
