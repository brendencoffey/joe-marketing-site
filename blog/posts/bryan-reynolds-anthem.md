## Bryan Reynolds' Formula for Success

Bryan Reynolds has built Anthem Coffee & Tea into one of the most beloved coffee brands in the South Puget Sound region. We sat down with him to learn his formula for success.

## The Foundation: Heroic Hospitality

At the core of Anthem's success is what Bryan calls "Heroic Hospitality" - going above and beyond at every opportunity to create memorable experiences for customers.

"It's not about just making good coffee," Bryan explains. "It's about making someone's day better. Every interaction is an opportunity."

## Key Principles

### 1. Hire for Heart, Train for Skill
Bryan looks for team members who genuinely care about people. Technical skills can be taught; genuine warmth cannot.

### 2. Know Your Community
Anthem is deeply embedded in the Tacoma community. They know their regulars by name, understand what the neighborhood needs, and show up for local events.

### 3. Never Stop Improving
Whether it's sourcing better beans, upgrading equipment, or implementing new technology like joe, Anthem is always looking for ways to serve customers better.

## The Role of Technology

Bryan sees technology like joe as an extension of hospitality, not a replacement for it:

"Mobile ordering lets us serve our customers on their terms. Some days they want to linger and chat. Other days they need to grab and go. joe gives them options without sacrificing quality."

## Advice for Fellow Shop Owners

"Focus on service first. The revenue follows when you truly serve your community. And don't be afraid to embrace technology that helps you serve better."
