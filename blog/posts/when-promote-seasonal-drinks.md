One of the advantages of being part of the joe network is access to data from thousands of coffee shops across the country. We've analyzed ordering patterns to help you understand the best times to promote seasonal drinks.

## The Hot vs Cold Transition

Every year, there's a clear transition period when customers shift from hot drinks to iced drinks - and back again. Understanding this timing can help you:

- Optimize your menu
- Time your promotions perfectly
- Reduce waste from over-preparing seasonal items
- Maximize revenue from seasonal offerings

## What the Data Shows

### Spring Transition (Hot to Cold)

The shift from hot to iced drinks typically begins:
- **Late March** in southern markets
- **Mid-April** in most markets
- **Early May** in northern markets

Key insight: Don't wait until it's hot outside. Customers start craving iced drinks as soon as they see consistent sunny days, even if temperatures are still mild.

### Fall Transition (Cold to Hot)

The shift back to hot drinks begins:
- **Late August** in northern markets
- **Mid-September** in most markets
- **Early October** in southern markets

Key insight: Pumpkin spice season starts earlier than you think! Customers are ready for fall flavors well before the leaves start changing.

## Recommendations for Shop Owners

### For Spring/Summer:

1. **Start promoting iced drinks in early March** - Get ahead of the curve
2. **Feature cold brew prominently** - It's become a year-round favorite
3. **Highlight refreshing flavors** - Fruity, citrus, and mint perform well

### For Fall/Winter:

1. **Launch fall menu in late August** - Beat the competition
2. **Lean into comfort flavors** - Spices, chocolate, and caramel
3. **Promote warm drinks for the morning commute** - Even on mild days
