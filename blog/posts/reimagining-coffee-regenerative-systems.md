*This post is part of the "Building In Public" Series. No flashy editing, no perfect sound bites—just raw, honest conversations about what it really takes to scale a mission-driven business.*

## A Moment of Integrity

It's been a while since we released one of these "Building in Public" updates. Truth be told, I bit off more than I could chew trying to edit past recordings. But today, I wanted to take a moment—raw and unfiltered—to update you on where we are, what we're learning, and why we're going all-in on a radical idea: **regenerative commerce**.

My brother and I started Joe with a deep commitment to serve independent coffee shops. Over time, that commitment has evolved into something bigger. Today, we're focused on creating systems that **align with natural principles**, support **mutual prosperity**, and transform the industry from **root to cup**.

## Why Quantum Physics Matters (Yes, Really)

It might sound strange to bring up quantum physics in a conversation about coffee. But bear with me.

Science is in the middle of a revolution—moving from materialism to something more expansive, more holistic. Quantum computing is becoming a reality. What if the next frontier of business mirrored this shift—toward models that are **nonlinear, interconnected, and fundamentally regenerative**?

The past century of commerce was built on exploitation and extraction. But nature shows us another way: **balance, homeostasis, and circular systems**. The same principles we apply to healthy ecosystems can be applied to the way we run our businesses.

## Breaking Through the Wall

We've been through the fire.

After the passing of our dad, our finances were exhausted, and Joe was on the brink. That moment cracked us open. We reconnected with our deeper "why," and began leading with heart as much as with head. From that place, the business began to shift. Fast.

Breakthroughs followed. The right people showed up. Doors opened. And today, I'm excited to share: **we're in the late stages of due diligence for our Series A round** with an investor who truly gets it—long-term, aligned, and as ambitious as we are.

## Betting on a Bigger Vision

Instead of scaling back, we've doubled down on our biggest ambition: to **rebuild the coffee value chain—from farmer to barista—with integrity, transparency, and shared value**.

That includes:

- A marketplace that connects everyone in the ecosystem
- Tools that empower small businesses
- Business models that uplift producers

We're no longer pretending we have to play small to survive. We're aiming to **transform lives, not just raise rounds**.

## Farmer First: A System Out of Balance

One of the most heartbreaking discoveries on this journey has been the harsh realities facing coffee farmers.

Thanks to leaders like Bob Fish and the folks at One Bigg Island in Space (OBIIS), we've learned that **60% of coffee consumed in the U.S. comes from farms under 12 acres**—many of which are selling coffee at prices below their cost of production. The average gate price (what farmers actually receive) has barely changed since 1972: around $1.46/lb. The cost to produce? Over $2.50/lb.

That's not just unsustainable. It's unjust.

We believe it's time to apply the same reverence we give to wine—origin, terroir, craft—to coffee. It's time to **elevate the producers**, not just the product.

## From App to Operating System

Joe started as a mobile ordering app. Today, we're proud to say we've evolved into a full operating system for independent coffee shops—and we've done it profitably with a lean team.

The next step? **Build infrastructure that lifts the whole ecosystem**:

- Buying power for shops
- Direct access for roasters and suppliers
- Transparent supply chains that include the farmer

This is only possible through **collaboration and coalition-building**. And we're just getting started.

## A Call to Action

We're looking for **regenerative commerce strategists**, **coffee industry veterans**, and **early-stage builders** who aren't chasing big paychecks or exits—but who believe in transforming systems.

If you're motivated by purpose over profit, if you have hard-won wisdom in this industry, or if you know someone who does—we want to talk to you.

Let's build something radically different. Together.

## The Bigger Picture

When we started Joe, people thought we were nuts to put competing coffee shops on the same app. Today, we have the data to show it works. The pie grows when we collaborate.

Here's a stat that blew my mind:

> More people use the Starbucks app to pay than use Apple Pay.
> Starbucks is the 10th largest bank in the world.
> And yet, there are **5x more independent coffee shops** in the U.S. than Starbucks locations.

The potential of small businesses working together is staggering.

Let's unlock it.
