Watch this webinar for an insightful and actionable conversation on creating a more inclusive workspace to improve the performance of your company and better serve your community.

## The Third Place

Coffee shops have long been considered "third places"—spaces between home and work where community happens. But for third places to truly serve their communities, they must be inclusive and welcoming to all.

## Key Topics

- Understanding unconscious bias
- Creating welcoming spaces for all customers
- Building diverse teams
- Inclusive marketing and communication
- Community engagement best practices

## Why This Matters

An inclusive coffee shop is a stronger coffee shop. When all customers feel welcome, you build a broader community, create more loyal customers, and make a positive impact in your neighborhood.
