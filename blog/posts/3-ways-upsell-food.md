## The Mobile Upsell Advantage

Mobile ordering changes the psychology of purchasing. Without a line behind them, customers browse more, consider more, and ultimately buy more. Here's how to capitalize on that.

## 1. Strategic Menu Placement

On mobile, you control exactly what customers see and when they see it.

### What Works:
- **Feature food prominently**: Don't bury pastries at the bottom
- **Use appetizing photos**: Visual triggers drive impulse purchases
- **Pair suggestions**: Show a croissant when someone orders a latte

### Pro Tip:
Create a "Perfect Pairings" section that suggests food items based on drink selections.

## 2. Bundle Pricing

Bundles feel like a deal and increase average ticket size.

### Effective Bundles:
- **Breakfast combo**: Coffee + pastry at a slight discount
- **Snack pack**: Drink + two treats for shareable occasions
- **Meeting bundle**: Multiple drinks + assorted pastries for office orders

### Pro Tip:
Price bundles so the individual items would cost 15-20% more if purchased separately.

## 3. Time-Based Promotions

Different times of day call for different upsells.

### Morning Rush (6-9 AM):
- Push quick breakfast items
- Emphasize grab-and-go options

### Mid-Morning (9-11 AM):
- Promote second breakfast / snacks
- Target the "treat yourself" mindset

### Afternoon (2-4 PM):
- Focus on pick-me-up treats
- Suggest pastries that pair with afternoon drinks

### Pro Tip:
Use joe's scheduling features to rotate featured items throughout the day.

## The Bottom Line

Mobile ordering isn't just about convenience - it's a powerful sales tool. When used strategically, it can significantly boost your food sales and overall revenue.
