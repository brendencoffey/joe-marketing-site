## Why Mobile Ordering for Coffee Shops Hasn't Rivaled Starbucks... Yet

Mobile ordering and loyalty is top of mind for just about everyone in the indie coffee space. With national chains generating major returns, indie coffee pros have looked for ways to compete, but largely found solutions built for restaurants and tried to shoehorn it into their business with lackluster results.

We live in an era where convenience is at a premium and too often people pass up the experiences they prefer for products that are "good enough" when they are ultra convenient. At joe, we took it as our duty as former baristas to stand up for indie coffee and empower owners to provide great experiences for customers that beat what national chains can offer.

## Key Statistics

- **75%** of coffee is consumed on-the-go
- Mobile order customers spend **20-30% more** per transaction
- **60%** of coffee drinkers would use mobile ordering if available
- Starbucks generates over **$3 billion** in mobile orders annually

## The joe Difference

We built joe specifically for coffee shops - not restaurants. That means:

- Coffee-specific menu building
- Built-in loyalty that drives repeat visits
- Network effects that benefit all indie shops
- No contracts, no monthly fees
