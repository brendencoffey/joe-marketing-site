Mobile ordering isn't just a convenience—it's a game changer for independent coffee shops. Here are three compelling reasons why you should embrace mobile ordering now:

## 1. Increased Visit Frequency

joe users visit the coffee shops they love MORE often than before they used the app for mobile ordering. When ordering is frictionless, customers return more frequently.

## 2. Higher Average Tickets

Mobile orders typically have higher average tickets than in-store orders. Customers take more time to browse the menu and add items when ordering from their phones.

## 3. Customer Loyalty

Mobile ordering creates stickiness. Once customers have your shop in their app, they're more likely to choose you over competitors.

The data is clear: mobile ordering drives growth for independent coffee shops. Don't wait to get started.
