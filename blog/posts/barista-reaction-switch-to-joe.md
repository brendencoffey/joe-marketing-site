> *"I love it. I love it...You guys just very clearly know how and what baristas need and what's gonna work best for us. That's already very clear in this app."*

That's Morgan—an experienced barista and shop leader—reacting to her first look at Joe.

Her response captures what we hear time and again from coffee pros: **Joe gets it.** From day one, our platform was built to serve the people behind the bar and support the shops that bring neighborhoods together.

We believe baristas deserve tools that *just work*, shops deserve launches that *drive traffic*, and partners deserve pricing that's *fair and transparent*.

That's why we're launching a new, limited-time offer for shops going live in **May or June**—with meaningful savings and real support built in.
