We're teaming up with BriteVision to bring our coffee partners affordable, eco-friendly coffee sleeves.

## About the Partnership

BriteVision creates high-quality, customizable coffee sleeves that help coffee shops build their brand while reducing environmental impact. We're excited to offer this benefit to joe partners.

## Why Coffee Sleeves Matter

Coffee sleeves are a touchpoint with every customer. They're an opportunity to:

- Reinforce your brand
- Share your story
- Promote mobile ordering
- Demonstrate environmental commitment

## Eco-Friendly Options

BriteVision's sleeves are made from recycled materials and are fully recyclable. Supporting local coffee shouldn't mean compromising on sustainability.

## Get Started
