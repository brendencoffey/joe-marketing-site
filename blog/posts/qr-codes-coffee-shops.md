QR codes made a massive comeback during the pandemic. What started as a contactless solution has evolved into a powerful tool for coffee shops to drive engagement, sales, and loyalty.

If you're only using QR codes to display your menu, you're missing out on significant opportunities.

## Beyond the Menu: What QR Codes Can Do

### 1. Direct Mobile Ordering

Instead of just showing a menu, QR codes can take customers directly to your mobile ordering system. Benefits:

- **Reduced wait times** - Customers order while waiting in line
- **Higher ticket averages** - Digital ordering typically increases average order size
- **Fewer errors** - Customers enter their own customizations
- **Better data** - Capture customer preferences and ordering patterns

### 2. Loyalty Program Sign-ups

Place QR codes at checkout to encourage loyalty sign-ups:

- Customers scan while their drink is being made
- Instant enrollment in your rewards program
- Start earning points on their very first purchase

### 3. Customer Feedback

QR codes on receipts or table tents can link to quick feedback forms:

- Capture real-time customer sentiment
- Address issues before they become bad reviews
- Show customers you care about their experience

### 4. Social Media & Reviews

Drive your online presence:

- Link to your Instagram for follow requests
- Direct happy customers to leave Google reviews
- Share your latest promotions

### 5. Gift Card Purchases

Make gifting easy:

- Place QR codes near the register during holidays
- Link directly to digital gift card purchase
- Customers can buy and send in seconds
