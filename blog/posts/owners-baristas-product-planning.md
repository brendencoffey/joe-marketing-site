This post is part of our Building In Public series, where we're pulling back the curtain on our journey to transform the coffee industry to better serve small business owners.

At Joe, we believe that coffee is more than just a drink—it's a community. It's the relationships built over the counter, the shared knowledge among shop owners, and the support that fuels independent businesses. That's why we're launching a **new community hub**, a space designed to bring coffee professionals together, gather valuable feedback, and make running a shop easier than ever.

## Why the Community Hub?

Through years of working closely with coffee shop owners, we've seen firsthand how valuable their feedback is. But often, that feedback gets lost in translation. The **Joe Community Hub** is designed to **eliminate the game of telephone**, giving partners a direct line to product updates, feature requests, and each other.

> "Our product is built for local coffee shops, so local coffee shops should inform how we build. This hub will allow us to get feedback early and often. We're still small enough to be nimble—so if there's a change that can help your shop, we want to know about it."

## How Coffee Shops Benefit

The Joe Community Hub isn't just about product updates—it's about **connecting shop owners with each other**.

Key benefits include:

✅ **Product Update Channel** – Stay informed about the latest features, see release dates, and access support articles.

✅ **Feature Request Section** – Have an idea for an improvement? Submit suggestions directly to our product team and even test new features before launch.

✅ **Coffee Community Forum** – Connect with shop owners across the U.S., discuss challenges, and learn best practices.

✅ **Roaster & Supplier Spotlights** – Discover incredible roasters and vendors, many of whom are already on the Joe platform.

✅ **Expert Webinars & Learning Sessions** – From pricing strategies to supply chain trends, get insights from industry leaders.

## Leveraging Data & Insights for Coffee Shops

One of the most exciting parts of the hub is how it will empower coffee shop owners with **data-driven insights** that they can't get anywhere else.

> "We have millions of customer profiles and purchase behaviors. By tapping into this data, we can give coffee shop owners real trends that help them make better business decisions—whether it's pricing, menu adjustments, or seasonal trends."
