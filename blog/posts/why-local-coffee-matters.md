Walk into any indie coffee shop, and you'll notice something different. Maybe it's the hand-painted mural on the wall, the barista who remembers your name, or the way the owner greets regulars like old friends.

## The Numbers Tell a Story

When you spend $5 at a local coffee shop, roughly **$3.50 stays in your community**. That money pays local baristas, supports local suppliers, and gets reinvested in your neighborhood.

## What You Can Do

Supporting local coffee doesn't require a revolution:

1. **Try somewhere new** — Use joe to discover a shop you've never visited
2. **Tell your friends** — Word of mouth is how local shops thrive
3. **Tip your baristas** — 100% of tips on joe go directly to the person who made your drink
4. **Be patient** — Great coffee takes time
5. **Show up** — Regular customers are the backbone of every indie shop

That's why local coffee matters. And that's why we do what we do at joe.
