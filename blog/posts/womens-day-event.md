joe Coffee is thrilled to sponsor a Virtual Coffee Hour for World Affairs Council of Seattle's Annual International Women's Day Speed Mentorship event.

## Celebrating Women in Coffee

The coffee industry has a rich history of women leaders, from farmers to roasters to shop owners. This International Women's Day, we're proud to support an event that connects women for mentorship and professional development.

## About the Event

The World Affairs Council of Seattle's Speed Mentorship event brings together women from diverse industries for meaningful conversations and connections—all over coffee, of course.

## Our Commitment

At joe, we're committed to supporting diversity in the coffee industry and beyond. We believe that independent coffee shops are community spaces where everyone should feel welcome.

Happy International Women's Day to all the incredible women in coffee!
